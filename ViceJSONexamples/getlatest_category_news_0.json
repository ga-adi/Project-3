Photo via the Center for American Progress's <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr account</a> </p><p><strong><em>Read: </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/an-alien-hunters-guide-to-the-2016-election\" target=\"_blank\">An Alien Hunter's Guide to the 2016 Election</a></em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/an-alien-hunters-guide-to-the-2016-election\" target=\"_blank\"></a></strong><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/an-alien-hunters-guide-to-the-2016-election\" target=\"_blank\"></a> </p><p>Over the last several months, the presidential candidates in both parties have staked out claims on the issues that matter to ordinary Americans. Ted Cruz is the candidate for evangelical conservatives. Bernie Sanders is the candidate for liberals who want the Democratic Party to move to the left. Donald Trump is the candidate for angry Americans who like <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/donald-trump-has-small-hands\" target=\"_blank\">men who lie about the size of their hands</a>. And Hillary Clinton is the candidate for people who want the government to tell us more about UFOs. </p><p>Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, underscored that fact earlier this week when he <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/john-podesta-wants-ufo-files-declassified.html\" target=\"_blank\">went on local TV in Las Vegas</a> and said that he wants to declassify documents related to UFOs. He's \"talked to Hillary about that,\" he says. \"I think I've convinced her that we need an effort to declassify as much as we can so people have their legitimate questions answered.\" </p><p>This is not a joke: Podesta has long advocated the declassification of documents on principal. When he was White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton, he helped set \"hundreds of millions\" of such documents free, <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/i-team-clinton-aide-seeks-ufo-files\" target=\"_blank\">according to the KLAS-TV report</a>, and when he left his gig as an advisor to Barack Obama, he said that his <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/outgoing-obama-adviser-john-podesta-s-biggest-regret-of-2014--keeping-america-in-the-dark-about-ufos-234149498.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"biggest regret\"</a> was not doing more to disclose UFO-related files. </p><p>Hillary Clinton once joked to a New Hampshire paper that we <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/an-alien-hunters-guide-to-the-2016-election\" target=\"_blank\">might have been visited by aliens before</a>, but her husband Bill might have been a little more serious about the subject—he <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bill-clinton-asked-aides-ufos-article-1.1745121\" target=\"_blank\">apparently once asked around</a> to see if the government knew anything about aliens.</p><p>Little green men aside, a lot of people believe that the US government <a href=\"\" i=\"\" think=\"\" i've=\"\" convinced=\"\" her=\"\" that=\"\" we=\"\" need=\"\" an=\"\" effort=\"\" to=\"\" declassify=\"\" as=\"\" much=\"\" can=\"\" so=\"\" people=\"\" have=\"\" their=\"\" legitimate=\"\" questions=\"\" answered,\"\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">classifies too many documents</a>; it's a cause Clinton would naturally be sympathetic to given that she's been accused of storing classified info on her private email server. Podesta, though, with his long-running personal campaign that's focused on UFOs in particular, isn't appealing to government transparency geeks so much as people who think the truth is out there. </p><p>There's basically no chance that this gets discussed seriously during the campaign, but if Sanders or the GOP made UFOs an issue, it's worth nothing that like any good political pro, Podesta has his finger on the public's pulse: According to <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/09/28/you-are-not-alone-most-people-believe-aliens-exist/\" target=\"_blank\">one poll</a>, 54 percent of Americans believe in extraterrestrials, and 30 percent of those people believe that the government has covered up evidence of an alien visit. </p>",

Marco Rubio, Trump said, \"hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?\" While the crowd laughed, Trump went on: \"He referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.\" </p><p>\"OK,\" moderator Bret Baier said, clearly not knowing what to do with that. \"Moving on.\" </p><p>But the mogul wasn't ready to move on. After the debate, Trump approached a reporter to <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/271766-trump-compares-hands-with-reporter-after-gop-debate\" target=\"_blank\">compare hands</a>, saying, \"My hands are bigger than yours\" and insisting that his hands were \"good-sized\" and \"very beautiful.\" </p><p>This obsession with telling people about the size of his hands goes back decades—<em>decades</em>—and apparently began when Graydon Carter, now the editor of <em>Vanity Fair</em>, decided to start an inside joke. <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/graydon-carter-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">He explained it last year in an editor's note:</a></p><p>\"Like so many bullies, Trump has skin of gossamer. He thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else, but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self-image, he coils like a caged ferret. Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a '<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2016/02/donald-trumps-short-fingers-a-historical-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">short-fingered vulgarian</a>' in the pages of <em>Spy</em> magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him—generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/04/donald-trumps-hands-are-childlike-according-to-an-expert-body-image-1457115245.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"420\" data-original-height=\"595\" data-model-id=\"153297\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"donald-trumps-hands-are-childlike-according-to-an-expert-body-image-1457115245.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Trump takes his short fingers golfing in 2013. (Patrick Farrell/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images) </p><p>Like many topics that consume the public political debate, the size of Trump's hands and the slimness of his fingers is a controversy with two sides, but only one side can be correct: Are his hands the big, beautiful appendages he claims they are, or are they pathetic little stubs? </p><p>To get an unbiased opinion, I reached out to Dani Korwin, an agent at <a href=\"http://www.partsmodels.com/\">Parts Models</a>. Parts does exactly what its name suggests: cast models for jobs that require magnificent parts. The agency has been placing hand, leg, feet, and body models in advertisements and catalogs work since 1986. </p><p>Obviously Korwin couldn't examine Trump's hands in person, but I sent her a collection of photos of them and asked her opinion. </p><p>She was not kind. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/donald-trump-has-small-hands-body-image-1457117044-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"669\" data-model-id=\"153318\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"donald-trump-has-small-hands-body-image-1457117044.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Is this really the hand of a president?

They are somewhat smaller than what you would expect, certainly from someone of his stature.\" </p><p>\"He's not a short man, and you would expect him to have longer, more masculine fingers,\" she added.<br> </p><p>This, of course, echoes what Rubio has been saying to crowds on the campaign trail. \"He's like six-two.

When Korwin casts hand models, she's mostly looking for an even skin tone, she said. A nice shape, good nails, and nice cuticles are also something she considers. </p><p>Upon examining one close-up shot, she said, \"You can actually see the redness and sun spots. Whatever the underlying problems are, he's obviously been in the sun too much, and hasn't taken care of his hands.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/donald-trumps-hands-are-childlike-according-to-an-expert-body-image-1457115884-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"688\" data-model-id=\"153302\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"donald-trumps-hands-are-childlike-according-to-an-expert-body-image-1457115884.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Marco Rubio has reason to be proud of his hands.

(VINCE BUCCI/AFP/Getty Images)<br></p><p>The LAPD is testing a folding buck knife that was found buried on the perimeter of OJ Simpson's estate, <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/04/oj-simpson-knife-found-murders-nicole-brown/\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to a TMZ report.</p><p>The knife wasn't unearthed just in time for the popular FX Show <em>The People v. OJ Simpson: </em><em>American Crime Story, </em>though. Instead, the blade was apparently discovered by a construction worker as many as 18 years ago, and turned over to an off-duty traffic cop. But instead of, you know, doing the right thing, the officer allegedly took it home with him and stashed it away as a memento of a crazy case.</p><p>According to TMZ, in January, the now-retired cop decided to use the knife to spruce up his home a bit. So he called up a buddy in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division and asked for the Departmental Record (DR) number of the murder case. The idea was to have the knife displayed on his wall with the number engraved on the frame.</p><p>But the guy's cop pal freaked out and told current police officials. The LAPD demanded the retiree turn over the blade, and it is now being tested for hair, fingerprints, and DNA. TMZ reports that a source who's seen the knife thinks it might even have blood residue on it.</p><p>Of course, OJ can't be tried again for the murder, thanks to America's double jeopardy rule. But technically the murder case remains open, since the only real suspect was found not guilty. </p><p>Not that Simpson is necessarily <em>too </em>concerned about new details in his case: The former football star is currently doing time in a Nevada prison for an unrelated <a href=\"http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html\">kidnapping and armed robbery</a> conviction.</p><!--EndFragment-->",

                "body": "<p>On Monday afternoon, I was riding a train to Boston from Cambridge, Massachusetts, when I bumped into one of the more infamous convicted statutory rapists in America.</p><p>Owen Labrie, who made national headlines as the defendant in a lengthy New Hampshire prep school rape trial last year, was wearing a beige LL Bean fleece.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of his senior year at St. Paul's, Labrie—who was a prefect and once awarded the school's highest honor for \"selfless devotion to school activities\"—partook in a campus hookup game called, the \"Senior Salute.\" He was subsequently convicted for three misdemeanor statutory rape charges, a charge of endangering a child, and a felony computer charge—for seducing and fornicating with a 15-year-old girl. Labrie has since been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/10/29/owen-labrie-sentenced-to-year-in-jail-in-prep-school-sexual-assault-case/\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced</a> to a year in county jail and made to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/owen-labrie-prep-school-grad-registers-as-sex-offender-in-vermont/\" target=\"_blank\">register</a> as a sex offender. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">But there he was Monday afternoon, free—albeit under a strict curfew as he appeals his conviction. I recognized him instantly, as I was one of dozens of journalists who flocked to the cramped New Hampshire courthouse to cover the trial for VICE.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Media interest in the scandal at a prestigious prep school has been criticized by some, most notably Labrie's then attorney, J. W. Carney. The lawyer nonetheless saw fit to provide reporters with lengthy daily press conferences, and took to having his client shake hands with him in front of the camera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What sparked my own interest in the case was that a familiar phenomenon—the objectification of young women—was, at St. Paul's, said to be ritualized. The \"Senior Salute\" was basically a game where graduating seniors asked underclass students to meet for a romantic encounter, anything from a walk to sex. They would then tally their conquests, with victors in the conquest passing around a ceremonial mask, <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/19227887-95/labrie-sentenced-to-one-year-in-jail-as-st-pauls-rape-case-draws-to\">according</a> to prosecutors. But elaborate rich kid sex games aside, it was also a case that highlighted the basic difficulties of proving or disproving acquaintance rape, and came at a time when sexual assault on school campuses was receiving increased attention. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This was one of the rare cases that actually went to a public trial. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Adding to the drama on Monday, seconds after I stepped onto the train, a man got his arm stuck in the door. The whole train car screamed while a woman pulled him loose. As the poor guy quietly walked on board, rubbing his arm, another man pulled out a Rubix cube and began to curse the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) at the top of his lungs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's when I walked over to Labrie. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">I introduced myself as a reporter who covered his trial, and I sat down. To my surprise, Labrie greeted me warmly. He said he liked VICE's coverage, but since I had <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/who-will-the-jury-believe-in-the-new-england-elite-prep-school-rape-trial-827\">compared him to a contemporary</a> of the protagonist in <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em>, I am skeptical he actually read it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He was visiting his girlfriend, a Harvard student, and had taken her out to brunch, Labrie told me. They met at the end of his senior year, around the same time as the incident for which he was later convicted. She quietly supported him in the courtroom, he maintained. After many months at his home in Vermont, Labrie said he was just beginning to reenter society. It was a process that was at times rewarding, with strangers approaching him to offer their support. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Strangers have also come up to him and literally thrown blows, he told me, miming a punch to the face.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He talked about emotional \"ups and downs\" and having his life \"torn apart\" in the media. It was strange, perhaps, for him to be commiserating with me—arguably one of those responsible for tearing him apart. We only had five stops to go, but I was curious to learn what he made of all the attention. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labrie's case continued to grab me after the trial itself, mostly because of the lingering media coverage. A professor at Harvard Law, writing for the <em>New Yorker</em>, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/st-pauls-school-and-a-new-definition-of-rape\">suggested</a> the case was about Americans criminalizing sex we don't like. A <em>Newsweek</em> <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/photos-owen-labries-life-vermont-after-his-rape-conviction-406648\">feature</a> and photoshoot focused, among other things, on the chapel he's been building since his conviction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">His attorneys made frequent note to that chapel in sentencing, too. As if a man's piety is evidence of his innocence. Hasn't anyone else watched <em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/spotlight-celebrates-the-power-of-journalism-to-fight-corruption-1110\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight</a></em>?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labrie was miffed about a new <em>Vanity Fair</em> feature, \"<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/st-pauls-owen-labrie-rape-trial\">St. Paul's Before and After the Owen Labrie Rape Trial</a>,\" that came out this week. I hadn't read it yet, but he warned it was a \"hit piece.\" (Jezebel, for its part, <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/labries-life-is-also-in-shambles-vanity-fair-also-does-1762224061\">argued</a> the story didn't hit hard enough and claimed the magazine \"doesn't know how to cover sexual assault.\") </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Varied public opinion is inevitable in instances of acquaintance rape, where the victim makes no claims of physically resisting the encounter. These cases involving consent inevitably rest on who the jury believes most—the alleged victim or the defendant. The jury essentially determined that Labrie was lying to the court when he claimed they didn't have sex, but the jurors did not find that the girl clearly expressed her lack of consent. He was acquitted of the more serious rape charges.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"That does not mean the victim consented to the sexual penetration,\" Judge Larry M. Smukler reminded the court during sentencing, countering Carney's assertion that this was a consensual act between teens. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those sympathetic to Labrie point to the felony computer charge, arguing it was never meant to be applied to texting teenagers. Had Labrie reached out to the girl via phone, he would have been spared a lifetime on the sexual offender registry. Then again, these were no ordinary messages: Labrie and his peers shared email templates and strategies for scoring with younger girls; Labrie even had a list of potential targets, with the girl at the top, in capital letters. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nancy Gertner, a professor at Harvard Law and a former federal judge, has said that in cases where there is some overlap—when online messages between teenagers cross the line from flirtations to calculated targeting—the felony law should be modified, just as Labrie's statutory rape charge was modified to a misdemeanor because of the closeness in age between him and the victim.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Gertner believes the defense still had no business taking the case to trial.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"This was a fundamentally 'untriable' case,\" she tells me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before Labrie found Carney, he went through two other attorneys and <a href=\"http://www.wcvb.com/news/convicted-prep-school-grad-turned-down-lighter-plea-deals/36159920\" target=\"_blank\">refused multiple plea deals</a>—including at least one in which he would have served only a month in jail and done no time on the sex offender's list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the terms of consent may have rested on only the word of two people in a dark room, the evidence that the two had sex was much more hefty. The prosecution presented evidence of semen and DNA, a vaginal tear, testimony, and documents of Labrie's written and spoken assertions to his peers that the two did in fact have sex. Even if Labrie's explanation—dry humping, premature ejaculation, boyish bragging—were true, it's difficult to imagine how he or his attorneys were convinced it would carry the day.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to<em> Vanity Fair, </em>which cited a senior law enforcement source, if at any time during the investigation Labrie acknowledged wrongdoing or regret, he likely would have been sent to a sex-offender diversion program, and never been convicted at all. No jail time, no prolonged public scrutiny. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's what ultimately makes Labrie come off as pathological: his own arrogance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the train this week, Labrie told me what he's said before: Pleading not guilty, instead of quietly settling, was a matter of his belief that he knew the truth. Something he did to sleep at night. Something for which he has no regrets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He continued to praise me and inquire about my chosen profession as an independent writer. I had run into an acquaintance from high school just minutes prior, but somehow meeting Labrie was less awkward. I started to feel bad for him. What if this whole case really was an elaborate plot? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">We got off at South Station in Boston. I took a few steps, and I realized he'd been charming people the same way he did me his entire life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Follow Susan Zalkind on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/susanzalkind\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",

(Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images For alice + olivia by Stacey Bendet) </p><p>At <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/what-we-learned-from-last-nights-horrifying-republican-debate\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday night's Republican debate</a>, the candidates didn't really get into the nitty-gritty of policy—the Fox News broadcast instead focused on personal attacks, the size of front-runner Donald Trump's penis, and incoherent shouting about polls. That's par for the course, as this year's GOP primary campaign has been all about insults and noise. Still, you couldn't help but wonder why the moderators didn't save a question to tackle Trump's seven-point <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform\" target=\"_blank\">health care plan</a>, which was posted to his campaign website on Wednesday and goes into a surprising amount of detail given that the real estate mogul has been notoriously light on which policies he would actually push as president. </p><p>The plan includes some items that are on most Republican wish lists when it comes to health care reform, including the repeal of Obamacare and removing restrictions on how Medicaid money is spent. But it also features some proposals guaranteed to piss big pharma companies off, like the recommendation that rules against importing prescription drugs be loosened. </p><p>But when you add it all up, what do you get? To go into more detail about Trump's plan, we called up Gerald F. Kominski, a professor who is the director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research*. He said that there were some good points, but in the end, \"we'll be much worse off because of this proposal.\" </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>VICE: Let's start with the basics: Why this demand at the top that Obamacare be repealed?<br></strong></span><strong>Gerald F. Kominski: </strong>The simplest thing is that he's running as a Republican. Republicans made Obamacare the lightning rod for everything that's wrong with the United States. Like, <i>It's responsible for global warming, air pollution</i>. It's just a blanket hatred of this law. In order for him to appeal to a Republican base, he's gotta say that this is a horrible law. He's just being consistent with what Republicans have been saying for the past six years. </p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>If he wanted to, couldn't he make alterations to Obamacare instead of repealing it?<br></strong>He absolutely could do that. I think the reason he's not doing it is because he's strategically decided that will cost him votes. So, like he does on a lot of things, he's just going all in. That's his style. </p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>What about the second point, which calls for allowing companies to sell insurance across state lines? That's another talking point for Republicans, right?<br></strong>Right now, insurance companies have difficulties marketing a product across the country. Health insurance is largely regulated at the state level. And there's federal law that protects the states' right to regulate health insurance. What he's saying—and Republicans have proposed this over the years—is, \"Let's get rid of the state regulation of health insurance. Let's just let insurance companies do business in any state that they want to.\" </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>So it's in line with his free-enterprise rhetoric.<br></strong></span>Exactly. This way, you guarantee that the minimal possible regulations rule nationally. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>His third point would allow people to deduct health insurance premiums from their taxes, and the plan points out,</strong><strong> \"</strong></span><strong>Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn't Congress allow individuals the same exemptions?\" That doesn't sound too bad to me, actually.<br></strong>It's not an unreasonable proposal. I think the biggest shortcoming of this is that it will increase the federal deficit. Basically, it means that people won't be paying taxes [on health insurance]. Individuals who get their insurance through work already are exempt from taxes. The health insurance premiums that you pay at work for many people are exempt from taxes right now. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i></i></span> </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tell me about \"price transparency,\" which is one of the other things Trump proposes. </strong></span><br>Of all the things he proposes, this is the one I agree with the most. I really don't like most of the aspects of this [plan], but what he's saying is, right now, when people pay for health care services, it's hard to get any good information about what it's gonna cost. If you try to look on the internet and do some comparison shopping, it's hard to find the information, and it's not always very reliable. </p><p class=\"p2\">One of the problems with hospitals and health care is that they will bill you a certain amount for their services, but then end of up accepting much less than the bill amount as their final payment. What he's saying—and what a lot of people in our field have been saying for years now—is that what really matters is what doctors and hospitals except as their final payment, not what they bill or charge for their service. Think about buying a car: You get a sticker price, but then there's what you actually pay, and hopefully you're a good enough negotiator that you pay less than that price. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>How have companies been getting away with being secretive?<br></strong></span>I think it's a long story, but the short answer is they can, but they don't have to provide the information. So they don't. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Trump also wants \"b</strong></span><strong>lock-grant Medicaid to the states.\" That would mean removing the restrictions the federal government places on how Medicaid money is spent by the states, right?<br></strong>Creating block grants is something Republicans have wanted to do for a long time. [The idea is], <i>Look, the federal government is just going to give you money so you could run the program any way you want. We're not going to give you a lot requirements; we're just going to give you the freedom to spend that money in lots of different ways</i>. Republicans think that this is the way to fix Medicaid because it gives states more flexibility. The concern is that if the federal government doesn't hold the states to some standard, they could spend that money in a way that really wouldn't necessarily serve low-income people very well—which is the purpose of the Medicaid program. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The final point is a call to \"remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable, and cheaper products.\" What's at stake here?<br></strong></span>I think what he's signaling here is that he wants to say, <i>Look</i>, <i>we ought to be able to import drugs from other countries where they're cheaper. </i>There are currently barriers to do that because the companies manufacturing pharmaceuticals around the world are not necessarily subject to the FDA regulations. There's possible safety concerns—however, what he's saying is that if we could figure out a way to guarantee that something made in India is safe, then we ought to be able to import those drugs, because that will drive prices down. The same drug in India is much less expensive than the drug being sold here. </p><p class=\"p2\">If you can guarantee safety, it's not a bad idea at all. It's just an issue of guaranteeing. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>So what would happen if all these proposals became reality?<br></strong></span>Repealing Obamacare and the other aspects that he's proposing will basically rewind the clock to where we were in the early part of the 2000s. More people are going to be struggling to get coverage, and we're potentially going to unravel the progress that we've made. The people with the lowest incomes, who now have expanded access to Medicaid—switching to a block grant program is likely to allow states to push more people off of their Medicaid program. I think overall, we'll be much worse off because of this proposal. </p><p><em>Follow Brian Josephs on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bklyn_Rock\">Twitter</a></em>.<br> </p><p><strong><em>Correction 3/4:</em></strong><em> An earlier version of this article misstated Kominski's title at the </em><em>UCLA Center for Health Policy Research</em></p>",

                "body": "<p>About ten minutes into the eleventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential election, the party's front-runner, Donald J. Trump, reassured Americans about the size of his dick.</p><p>It happened quickly. The first question to Florida Senator Marco Rubio by Fox News anchor, Bret Baier, was about personal attacks—how he's gone, in a matter of weeks, from having a no-Trump-talk policy to more or less implying the man had a small penis. Trump's defense, on Thursday night in Detroit, Michigan: \"I guarantee you, there is no problem.\"</p><p>The moment was the clearest encapsulation of what political discourse has turned into in 2016, and needless to say, it set the tone for the rest of the debate. What followed was two hours of batshit crazy television, in which the remaining Republican candidates not named Donald Trump went balls to the wall against the real estate titan who has all but locked up the party's nomination. Mercifully, there were only four people left on the GOP debate stage—but the shrill shouting match that took place Thursday night had most viewers wishing that lobotomized neurosurgeon Ben Carson hadn't chosen this week to pull out of the race.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In many ways, the debate was a live reenactment of the long-simmering Republican panic, and the near-anabolic shock the party apparatus is currently experiencing, since realizing that Trump could really be the nominee in 2016. Acting as the chorus for this Greek tragedy were the debate moderators—Fox News's Chris Wallace, Brett Baier, and Megyn Kelly—who hammered Trump harder than anyone else on stage, scrutinizing his government spending plans, his blatant policy flip-flops, and those \"minor civil cases\" he faces for scamming students at \"Trump University.\" The trio threw up infographics, played back videos, and even cited court documents, attempting—perhaps in vain—to expose Trump's Achilles heel.</span></p><p>The first question of the night was about former presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who, earlier that day, decried Trump as the death toll of American democracy; a con artist who would plunge the nation into recession, and maybe even World War III. Reiterating his speech to supporters earlier that day, Trump called Romney a \"failed candidate,\" dying for the spotlight. A little later, at the coaxing of the moderators, Trump was once again forced to disavow the Ku Klux Klan. And then there was that dick question.</p><p>As the debate progressed, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz directed their fire at the front-runner, assailing Trump on his donations to Hillary Clinton, on the Trump University fraud cases, and on his business practices in general. \"You argue that you're here to fight for the American worker,\" Rubio basically shouted, \"but when you have a chance to fight for the American worker, you're hiring workers from overseas, and you're making your clothes overseas.\"</p><p>For most of the night, any discussion on serious policy issues devolved into a screaming match, reflecting the rowdy hecklers in the audience who intermittently distracted the candidates by yelling off-camera. Trump casually berated his opponents, referring to Rubio as \"Little Marco\" and to Cruz as \"Lying Ted.\" At times, it was hard to hear what was actually going on over the bickering matches and interruptions.</p><p>Taking place just a couple of days after Trump's routing on Super Tuesday, Thursday's debate was a darker sequel to <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/what-we-learned-from-last-nights-messy-and-bizarre-republican-debate\" target=\"_blank\">last week's face-off in Houston</a>, in which Rubio and Cruz finally eased up on each other and took on their common enemy. With Trump's path to the nomination increasingly set in stone, the need to stop his momentum, and carry the mantle for what's been dubbed the \"Never Trump Movement,\" seemed more dire and imminent Thursday night.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"If you don't want him to be the nominee,\" Cruz stated, in true Cruz fashion, staring at the camera, \"I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, who believe in freedom.\"</span></p><p>Notably, it was Cruz, not Rubio, who made the stronger case for being the best candidate to take on Trump, aided by the fact that the Texas senator won four states on Super Tuesday, compared to Rubio's dismal finish. Cruz's endless mentions of Trump's ties to Clinton, and his call for the reality-television billionaire to release tapes of an off-the-record conversation he had with the <i>New York Times </i>about immigration were aggressive and fresh. When Cruz condescendingly told Trump to \"breathe Donald, just breathe,\" the audience members applauded with him, almost audibly projecting their hopes of beating Trump onto the Texas senator. \"Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth,\" Cruz warned them.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rubio, on the other hand, seemed to be out of new attack lines; nothing he said Thursday seemed to stick—something that kinda needed to happen for him to remain relevant, especially as he trails behind Trump in his home state. His hits against the front-runner were all recycled, except for one on the billionaire businessman's \"flexibility\" on the issues, which included a yoga jab. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, Ohio Governor John Kasich, though still a non-factor in the 2016 race, had his best debate performance yet, in part because he got airtime without having to share stage space with Carson. As he has throughout this election cycle, Kasich leaned into his \"only adult in the room\" routine, refusing to go after rivals and basically begging the party to lighten up. </span></p><p>Whether this eleventh-hour resurrection will actually help Kasich remains to be seen. If the past 10,000 debates have taught us anything, it's that trying to predict the conservative electorate's reaction to these things is a waste of time and internet space.

He spent six years working at a factory in Illinois before moving to Wisconsin after finding a better job in the state's dairy industry. For more than a decade, Lopez—who was in the country illegally—worked 12-hour shifts, milking cows and caring for veal calves.</p><p>When he first moved to Wisconsin, Lopez was able to get a driver's license. But in 2005, a state law was passed that required drivers to have a Social Security number <a href=\"https://www.uwsuper.edu/oip/intl_curr/get-wi-id.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">or proof of legal immigration status</a>. So in 2012, when Lopez was involved in a minor fender bender near his home in Green Bay, he was driving without a license, and he feared that if he called the police to report the accident, he would be deported. Panicked, Lopez drove away.</p><p>Undocumented immigrants have good reason not to report crimes, as local police in <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/31-arrests-green-bay-ice-operation-targeting-criminals-immigration-fugitives\" target=\"_blank\">cities like Green Bay</a> share information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But about half an hour after Lopez's hit-and-run, he started to feel guilty, and he called the local police to turn himself in. No one was injured in the accident, and because the judge did not consider Lopez a public risk, he didn't serve jail time. He was charged with a felony, though, and placed on probation.</p><p>Then, two years later, on March 12, 2014, ICE showed up in the driveway of the Green Bay duplex where Lopez and his family had lived for seven years. \"It was a raid—they blocked the whole street,\" his daughter, Marisa Leza, told me. \"They could have taken my mom, too, but for some reason, they didn't.\" Lopez and one of Leza's three brothers were arrested, and deported back to Mexico. They were two of <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/dhs-releases-end-year-statistics\" \\t=\"\" \"_blank\"=\"\">414,481 immigrants deported</a> from the United States that year.</p><p>These deportations could soon become more common in Wisconsin, thanks to a pending state bill that would impose a fine on \"sanctuary cities,\" or cities with policies limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. Cities like Racine, Madison, and the county of Milwaukee would face fines of up to $5,000 per day that their sanctuary policies are in place. </p><p>The bill, known as <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/proposals/ab450\" target=\"_blank\">AB 450</a>, was approved by the Wisconsin Assembly on February 16, by a vote of 62 to 35. Since then, Wisconsin's Republican Governor Scott Walker has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/370028701.html\" target=\"_blank\">discouraged the State Senate from taking up the legislation</a>. But a sister bill, SB 533, which would limit local government's ability to issue identification cards, has passed both houses, and is waiting for Walker's approval. It's unclear whether or not he will sign it into law.</p><p><a href=\"http://wisconsinwatch.org/2009/11/immigrants-now-40-of-states-dairy-workforce/\" target=\"_blank\">Forty percent</a> of Wisconsin's dairy workers are immigrants, the vast majority of them Mexican, according to the most recent data from 2008. Late last month, thousands of those workers joined protests against AB 450 in Madison, the state capital. \"We realized that unless there was a dramatic call to action this would be the state law,\" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of <a href=\"http://vdlf.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Voces de la Frontera</em></a>, the Milwaukee-based immigrant rights group that organized one of the protests.</p><p>Neumann-Ortiz pointed out that even in Wisconsin's \"sanctuary cities,\" undocumented immigrants still fear deportation and the police. Yaritza Brito, an undocumented Wisconsin teenager who organized more than a hundred of her classmates to join the protests last week, lives in Madison, a city that many consider a sanctuary, but she said that she doesn't feel safe there. She added that she has heard of domestic abuse situations that were not reported because of immigration status.</p><p> \"If these laws do get passed, it will just create more fear,\" Brito told me.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/04/the-fight-to-keep-sanctuary-cities-for-undocumented-immigrants-in-wisconsin-body-image-1457058652.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"593\" data-model-id=\"152885\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"the-fight-to-keep-sanctuary-cities-for-undocumented-immigrants-in-wisconsin-body-image-1457058652.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">A \"Day Without Latinos\" protest in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 18, 2016.

The police department already cooperates with the Department of Homeland Security in criminal cases, but also emphasizes community policing, and officers avoid asking residents about their legal status. Koval added that even if AB 450 is passed, it's not likely to change the way the Madison police force operates.</p><p>\"My concern is that you have this toxic atmosphere, conditions where candidates for the highest elected office are having serious discussions about deporting 11 million people and building the highest wall known to mankind,\" Koval told me, adding that the rhetoric makes community policing much more difficult. </p><p>\"[They've] already come from a country of origin where cops are not scrupulous. Now, you're living in a community where conditions suggest [they] are a group of people to be marginalized and detained,\" he said. \"It preys on the psyche of those who are living in the shadows.\"</p><p>The purported goal of AB 450 is to enhance public safety, <a href=\"http://immigrationreform.com/2016/02/17/wisconsin-assembly-passes-bill-to-ban-sanctuary-cities/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Republican State Representative John Spiros</a>, one of the bill's sponsors. In January, Wisconsin Republicans <a href=\"http://lc.legis.wisconsin.gov/comtmatfiles/ab0450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> a state assembly committee that the bill would \"protect law-abiding citizens\" and reduce crime caused by undocumented immigrants, claiming that sanctuary cities create a \"magnet\" for illegal immigrants. Neither Spiros nor State Representative Jesse Kremer, another sponsor of AB450, immediately returned requests for comment. </p><p>Sanctuary laws have existed since 1979, when the Los Angeles Police Department <a href=\"http://assets.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/SO_40.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">enacted a policy</a> to prevent officers from asking about someone's immigration status. According to Faye Hipsman, an analyst with the <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/\" \\t=\"\" \"_blank\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Migration Policy Institute</a>, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, DC, and 350 other local jurisdictions nationwide now have policies in place that limit local law enforcement's role in enforcing federal immigration law, although the rules vary widely.</p><p>But many states are reconsidering those policies, a shift sparked by the murder of <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/us-immigrant-sanctuary-policies-under-fire-after-alleged-murder-by-man-deported-5-times\" \\t=\"\" \"_blank\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kathryn Steinle</a>, a 32-year-old woman in San Francisco who was shot in the back and killed last July. The perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, was an undocumented immigrant who had already been deported five times and served jail time for multiple drug charges. He'd been released from San Francisco County jail three months before the murder, despite a request that he be turned over to federal authorities for deportation. </p><p>After Steinle's murder, Hipsman said, \"the momentum is toward cooperation with ICE.\" Last October, <a href=\"http://www.wral.com/mccrory-signs-bill-outlawing-sanctuary-cities-in-nc/15035244/\" target=\"_blank\">North Carolina</a> passed a law banning sanctuary cities; <a href=\"http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/f3132e892bfd453c935d57804abb4854/kansas-among-several-states-looking-ban-sanctuary-cities\" target=\"_blank\">Kansas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/01/13/florida-house-takes-aim-at-so-called-sanctuary-cities\" target=\"_blank\">Florida</a>, like Wisconsin, are debating new laws. Overall, more than a dozen state bills have been introduced limiting sanctuary cities. If passed, the legislation will likely reduce undocumented populations in those states, and further strain relations between immigrants and the police.</p><p>After Lopez's deportation, his wife lived in a constant state of fear; it seemed like nothing more than chance that ICE hadn't arrested her as well, according to his daughter, Marisa Leza. Lopez had been the family breadwinner, and that role has now fallen to Leza. She is one of <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2015/07/09/117054/results-from-a-nationwide-survey-of-daca-recipients-illustrate-the-programs-impact/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 650,000</a> young immigrants who are benefitting from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program implemented by the Obama administration in 2012—a program that most of the current Republican presidential candidates have promised to revoke. </p><p>Under DACA, Leza was able to obtain a Social Security number and a driver's license, allowing her to work legally in the US. She has a full-time job as an admissions counselor at a local college, and she works weekends at a trucking company to make extra cash. Her father, now back in his hometown of Saltillo, Mexico, has found part-time farm jobs here and there, but earns only a fraction of what he was making in Wisconsin, Leza said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wisconsin farmers are hoping to keep dependable immigrant employees on their payrolls. Last month, in the same week that protesters staged demonstrations against AB 450 in Madison, Wisconsin's Dairy Business Association <a href=\"http://www.widba.com/inthenews/wisconsin-dairy-industry-pushes-for-immigration-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">came out against the contested bills</a>.</p><p>\"It's necessary labor,\" Neumann-Ortiz said. \"You can't support the growth of the dairy industry and at the same time stigmatize workers.\"</p><p><em>Follow Kalee Thompson on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaleewrites\" \\t=\"\" \"_blank\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",

                "body": "<p>Throughout the 2016 campaign, the underlying narrative surrounding Donald Trump's juggernaut has been that the billionaire reality-TV star somehow has a mysterious connection to the working class. At his rallies, supporters, who The Donald has gushed over as \"the uneducated,\" have cheered at their candidate's aggressive \"<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/super-tuesday-put-the-republican-party-one-step-closer-to-being-ruled-by-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">fuck you</a>\" slogans about deporting Mexicans, banning Muslims, and taking on the Republican Establishment. They've clapped at his ability to \"tell it like it is,\" as if it is a monster truck demolition derby. One of the most popular signs at his campaign events reads, \"The Silent Majority Stands with Donald Trump.\"</p><p>But in Manhattan on Wednesday, outside a rally for Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, there was a gathering of another type of working folks, ones who are arguably more familiar with the real estate mogul from Queens than most Americans: New York City union workers.</p><p>The Democratic candidate had returned to her adopted home state after a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/hillary-clinton-had-a-very-super-tuesday\" target=\"_blank\">strong Super Tuesday</a>, hosting a public rally at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the giant Midtown venue near the Westside Highway. Clinton's posse of Empire State backers — New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and a handful of other elected officials—were on hand, joining her on the stage in a blue-state Establishment phalanx. In the stands, the organized labor forces who have provided the muscle to all of Clinton's campaigns, were lined up in battle positions.</p><p>The crowd wasn't exactly what we've come to expect from Clinton rallies: a herd of working-class, middle-aged men cheering on the most serious female candidate to ever run for the White House. Before the event, on the sidewalks outside, it felt more like a lunchtime construction site than a political affair: over pizza and cigarettes, the guys spent the remaining hours of their workday seemingly shooting the shit with one another, gathering with their respective cliques. One worker asked another where he should go to check in with his union local. \"Over here,\" his friend yelled back. \"We've got beer!\"</p><p>That New York workers support Clinton isn't totally unpredictable. Labor unions have been a bastion of Democratic power in New York, and nationally, for decades, and most of the major labor organizations, including the AFL-CIO, have been behind Clinton's campaign almost since its inception. But in 2016, at least, rank-and-file workers—like the ones that filled the Javits Center Wednesday—are suspected to be quietly breaking ranks with their Clinton-loving, left-wing labor chiefs, and defecting to Trump.</p><p>Trump himself has propped up this idea. \"I have tremendous support within unions, and I have tremendous support in areas where they don't have unions,\" he <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/8/donald-trump-i-have-tremendous-support-within-unio/\" target=\"_blank\">told a town-hall audience</a> in New Hampshire last month. \"I mean, my support is really with those workers, those people. That's it — the policemen, the firemen, the construction workers, the lathers, the sheetrock workers, the electricians, the plumbers. That's where my support is — every poll shows it.\" This was especially true in New York, Trump said, where, he added, \"I've done very well with unions.\"</p><p>At this week's Clinton rally, though, workers I spoke to—most of whom were unable to give their full names due to union restrictions—expressed more nuanced views of the Republican front-runner, rooted in years of experience working with Trump on his business holdings in the city. \"He's a bully,\" said Albert, a 53-year-old electrician. \"[He] thinks he's so powerful that he can do anything he want.\"</p><p>Albert gave me an example: In the week leading up to the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, held at New York City's Madison Square Garden, several of the league's players were staying at the Trump SoHo, a hotel overseen by Trump and two of his children; at the time, Albert was working a job at a nearby building, and the crew had to close a portion of the block to complete the project.</p><p>\"Our boss told us that Trump called the superintendent of the building, and said\"—at this point Albert put on his best Trump impersonation—\"'Why the fuck did you block my street?! Do you know who this is?'\" When the crew returned the next day, Albert said, the superintendent had closed the building, effectively shutting down the project. \"He's a bully,\" Albert added again, for emphasis.</p><p>Most of the workers I spoke to said they had, at one time or another, worked a job at a Trump property. And while most confirmed that, in business, Trump was known for bullying and intimidation tactics, they also said they see a divide between The Donald they worked for and The Donald on the campaign trail.</p><p>\"I've worked for Donald a bunch of times,\" said Gilbert, a carpenter from Costa Rica who has lived in New York City for 38 years, \"And I knew his dad, too. There was never a problem with the work. But everyone here will tell you,\" he continued, with a twirling finger-to-head gesture, \"that what he's saying to these people across the country is crazy.\"</p><p>Inside the Javits Center, just minutes before the candidate took the stage, I spoke with a carpenter named Mike, who was handing out \"Carpenters & Hillary\" signs at the entrance. \"He's a shrewd businessman,\" he told me, \"and he's done a lot for the unions.\"</p><p>According to Mike, even the people cheering for Clinton on Wednesday are facing an internal debate about which presumptive candidate to vote for in November: Clinton, the Establishment New York Democrat who voices the pro-labor lines they want to hear, or Trump, the rich guy who promises to be \"the greatest jobs president God ever created.\"</p><p>\"They haven't made up their mind yet,\" Mike said. \"There's a strong following for Trump, and there's a strong following for Hillary.\" When I asked him where he stands, he responded, \"I'm still on the fence.\"</p><p>It's worth noting again that this was a man handing out pro-Clinton signs, at a Clinton rally—a fact that speaks to the problems the Democratic front-runner might have should she face Trump in a general election.</p><p>Soon after, Clinton took the stage to Rachel Platten's \"Fight Song,\" a staple on her campaign playlist. This, indeed, was Clinton's victory lap. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/hillary-clinton-has-already-forgotten-about-bernie-sanders\" target=\"_blank\">Barely mentioning her Democratic rival</a> Bernie Sanders, she rattled off her achievements during her eight years as New York's junior US senator. And she sampled her anti-Trump sound bites, testing out a general election on the hometown audience. \"America never stopped being great,\" she yelled. \"We have to make America whole!\"</p><p>Behind the stands, Junior Alexander, a 45-year-old carpenter, waved a miniature American flag, and watched the candidate from afar. A native of Trinidad, Alexander said the biggest debate within union rank-and-file has been over Sanders and Clinton—many of his friends, he said, had felt the Bern, but were now coalescing behind Clinton as the more electable of the two. The Donald, he said, was no favorite, at least among the people he knows.</p><p>\"Trump is a bold businessman,\" Alexander said, \"and his boldness works for him—from what I can tell, he cannot be bought, and so there's nothing the Republicans can really do to stop him.\"</p><p>\"But he's spoiled, like a child is spoiled,\" he said. Then, as if appealing directly to Trump's fans, he added, \"You have to understand: He just wants business.\" He paused. \"They don't know Trump.\" </p><p><em>Follow John Surico on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnSurico\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter.</em></a> </p>",

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)<br></p><p><strong><em>Read: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/so-trump-makes-you-want-to-move-to-canada-eh-some-advice-from-an-american-already-living-here\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>So Trump Makes You Want to Move to Canada, Eh? Some Advice from an American Already Living Here</em></strong></a> </p><p>On Thursday in Salt Lake City, failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee and <em>Mad Men </em>extra Mitt Romney delivered a <a href=\"http://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/romney-expected-to-warn-voters-trump-nomination-ensures-clinton-presidency\" target=\"_blank\">much-hyped</a> speech during which he became the lucky 1 millionth person to say that Republican front-runner Donald Trump was bad. </p><p>Romney began his remarks by doing something the current GOP candidates rarely do, pointing out that America is doing pretty well, all things considered. He even dropped a Warren Buffet quote that said, \"The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.\" After listing some threats to the US, including a nuclear North Korea and terrorism, Romney reiterated that \"if we make the right choices, America's future will be better than our past.\" </p><p>The rest of the speech was devoted to explaining all the ways that Trump is the wrong choice, reasons that are by now familiar to anyone without a Make America Great Again hat. The mogul's economic policies, including a huge tax cut uncoupled from entitlement reform, would send the US into a recession; his foreign policies are basically just a list of war crimes; he seems like a racist, narcissistic boob who would continuously humiliate the country on the world stage. Then Romney, himself a scion of wealth whose massive fortune made him seem out of touch during the 2012 election, called Trump out for being a \"fraud\" and a \"phony\" whose past was littered with failures. </p><p>\"His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them,\" Romney said. \"And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's <em>Trump</em> magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not.\" </p><p>Other choice Romney insults included: </p><ul> <li>\"Dishonesty is Trump's hallmark: He claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into Iraq. Wrong, he spoke in favor of invading Iraq. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11. Wrong, he saw no such thing. He imagined it. His is not the temperament of a stable, thoughtful leader. His imagination must not be married to real power.\"</li> <li>\"Think of Donald Trump's personal qualities, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd-third grade theatrics.\"</li> <li>\"Donald Trump says he is very, very smart. I'm afraid when it comes to foreign politics, he is very, very not smart.\"</li> </ul><p>If you weren't a Trump supporter, these sorts of attacks may have seemed more grown-up and substantive than Ted Cruz's claims that Trump isn't a real conservative and Marco Rubio's juvenile jabs about <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/rubio-suggests-trump-has-small-genitals.html\" target=\"_blank\">the former reality star's penis size</a>. But Trump fans are likely going to ignore this sort of rant; their favored would-be strongman shrugged off this entire speech in the course of a tweet before Romney even uttered a word: </p><p><div class=\"twitter-container\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/statuses/705234524012224512\">March 3, 2016</a></blockquote></div> </p><p>Romney praised the remaining non-Trump candidates, but he didn't endorse any of them. Instead, he called for Republicans to vote for whoever has \"the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state.\" That desperate strategy, if it stopped Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates required for a nomination before the Republican National Convention, would  presumably lead to a lot of horse-trading and conflict at the RNC, a battle that would be unprecedented in the current political era. Then again, as Romney noted, \"the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign.\" What's one more oddity? </p>",

(Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for The Vanity Group)<br></p><p>Katt Williams was poised to put his career back on track this year with the Conspiracy Theory Tour, <span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KattPackAllDay\">twe<sub></sub>eting</a></span> in all caps last month about upcoming performances in St. Louis and Atlanta. But as has been the case with glaring frequency throughout his time in the public eye, the comedian's shows are now mere afterthoughts due to his off-stage legal woes.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On Monday, the 42-year-old was <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/comedian-arrested-for-punching-pool-store-employee/nqbhT/\" target=\"_blank\">arrested</a> in Gainesville, Georgia, on a battery charge for allegedly punching a pool supply store employee after <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/comedian-katt-williams-arrested-in-georgia/\" target=\"_blank\">throwing</a> a pair of goggles at him. On Wednesday, reports emerged that five women claim Williams and 15 members of his entourage physically assaulted them, held them at gunpoint, and stole their phones. As the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/crime-law/attorney-accuses-comedian-katt-williams-of-holding/nqb2C/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>, a woman named Salena Boston <span class=\"s2\">said </span>that at 2:30 AM on Sunday, she and a group of friends spotted Williams walking and approached him for a picture. After initially accepting, Williams allegedly started fighting the women when one of them began filming.</span> </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For his part, Williams <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/01/katt-williams-pool-store-arrest-n-word/\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <span class=\"s2\"><i>TMZ</i></span> about the pool incident, \"Katt Williams did what Katt Williams had to do,\" because the store clerk, he claims, used the N-word. And he says police found him lying down with his hands behind his back as if ready to go to jail. </span><span class=\"s1\">As for the more recent incident, Williams denied it, suggesting the group was harassing him and tried to snatch a chain from his neck. The comedian claims in the police report that at one point, one of the women said that \"she was going to her car to get something to pop somebody.\" </span></p><p>Williams was handcuffed in that second incident but not arrested. Regardless, the two altercations are just the latest episodes in the comedian's bizarre tenure in the celebrity spotlight. In fact, he's been involved in some two-dozen altercations and legal imbroglios over the years.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The trouble began with the success of <i>The Pimp Chronicles, Pt. 1</i>, Williams's first HBO special. In November 2006, he was <a href=\"http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/state/20061107-1025-ca-kattwilliams-arrest.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\">arrested</span></a> at LAX airport after a stolen gun was found in his briefcase. He pleaded no contest to carrying a concealed firearm and was sentenced to three years in probation.</span> </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His rap sheet has since become a punch line in and of itself. During one particularly unfortunate stretch in late 2012, Williams was arrested five times in two months on charges that included allegedly <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/katt-williams-arrested-in-oakland-after-show-accused-of-hitting-man-with-a-bottle/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\">beating</span></a> an 18-year-old with a bottle in his tour bus (November 15), <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/2012/12/02/micah-%E2%80%9Ckatt%E2%80%9D-williams-arrested-in-seattle/\" target=\"_blank\">attacking a family</a> outside a sports bar (December 2), and child endangerment after the LA County Department of Children and Family Services <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/comedian-katt-williams-arrested-child-407113\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> guns and illegal drugs at his home (December 28). He was slapped with bench warrants on <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/369688/katt-williams-arrest-warrant-issued-after-comedian-fled-from-police-on-three-wheeled-motorcycle\" target=\"_blank\">December 7</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/376709/katt-williams-wanted-again-arrest-warrant-issued-after-no-show-in-court\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> on J<span class=\"s2\">anuary 8, 2013,</span> for leading Sacramento police on a chase while riding a three-wheel motorcycle. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">The police <a href=\"http://blogs.sacbee.com/crime/archives/2012/12/warrant-issued-in-sacramento-county-for-comedian-katt-williams.html\" target=\"_blank\">aborted</a> that chase for safety reasons.</span></p><p><span class=\"s1\">And that burst came after Williams <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/01/katt-williams-faizon-love-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly</a> pulled a gun on comedian Faizon Love over a $50,000 debt and later <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BckOFH4f-jg\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> Love a <span class=\"s2\">snitch</span> for reporting it.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As you might expect, Williams's erratic behavior has spilled into his stand-up career. It got particularly bad in November 2012, when he kicked off the month by doing a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv-6C22I6Mo\"><span class=\"s2\">Denver show</span></a> that <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_21917969/katt-williams-fans-furious-after-bizarre-denver-show\" target=\"_blank\">involved</a> doing some push-ups, rocking a bare-chested look, and inviting a heckler on stage to spit on him. Two weeks later, Williams <a href=\"http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2012/11/kat_williams_comedian_brian_herline.php\" target=\"_blank\">tried to fight</a> at least three members of the audience in <span class=\"s2\">Oakland</span> after again taking off his shirt, according to a lawsuit.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There's more, including an incident on November 15, 2011, when Williams was <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2011/06/13/katt-williams-arrested-for-assaulting-tractor-trailor-driver.html\" target=\"_blank\">charged</a> with <span class=\"s2\">intimidating a witness</span> by refusing to let a tractor worker leave a home he was staying in after three women attacked him with rocks and dirt clods. Also: a June 24 run-in that same year where Williams's bodyguard <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2011/07/05/katt-williams-bodyguard-kills-retired-police-dog-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\">reportedly killed</span></a> a retired police dog in Arizona after he bit him. And Williams apparently managed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLqUmyM9tgY\" target=\"_blank\">get into a fight</a> with a promoter at an August 25, 2011, Young Jeezy concert.</span></p><p class=\"p2\">What's disheartening about Williams's ongoing struggles is how he was one of the more unique mainstream comedians of the early millennium. With his nasally voice and bits of slapstick, the humor of his performances came from how he stretched urban common knowledge into absurdities. There's high-quality weed, and there's <span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuNeJZq9Nuc\" target=\"_blank\">deaf</a>. Oh, a</span>nd the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CKiXBj2_CEo?t=4m43s\"><span class=\"s2\">Crocodile Hunter</span></a> was a gangster.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Williams had a bit of a career revival with his 2014 HBO special <i>Priceless: Afterlife,</i> but whatever mainstream momentum he regained was halted just a few months later: Williams and Suge Knight were <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/29/showbiz/suge-knight-katt-williams-arrested/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\">charged</span></a> with robbery for allegedly stealing a female paparazzo's camera. </span></p><p><span class=\"s1\"> He was arrested in that case while appearing in court for an unrelated assault charge.</span></p><p><i>Follow Brian Josephs at </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bklyn_rock\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Twitter</i></span></a>. </p>",

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Image) </p><p><em>This story was published in partnership with <a href=\"http://thecrimereport.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Crime Report</a>.</em> </p><p>Now in his seventh year in office, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck has both built and expanded on the reforms initiated by his predecessor and mentor William J. Bratton, who was LAPD chief from 2002–2009. In the process, Beck has become something of a rising star in the reformist wing of American policing—in large part due to his innovative community policing work. </p><p>Last October, he went to the White House with 130 other top law enforcement leaders to meet with President Barack Obama. The topic was the future of criminal justice reform, and Beck was chosen to speak with the president on the group's behalf. </p><p>But Beck has also come under attack in Los Angeles for, among other things, his handling of <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/a-third-of-the-people-who-got-shot-last-year-by-lapd-officers-were-mentally-ill\" target=\"_blank\">controversial officer-involved shootings</a>—which almost doubled in the city in 2015—prompting the local branch of Black Lives Matter to call for his resignation. In dealing with the media, Beck has been deliberate in not making the LAPD about himself—a rare occurrence in a department ruled for more than 40 years by thin-skinned chiefs. As a result, there have been few in-depth interviews with him. </p><p>In late January 2016, Joe Domanick interviewed Beck for over two hours. Their free-wheeling discussion covered a host of issues facing him and police executives nationwide, post-Ferguson. Below is an abridged and edited version of the interview. </p><p><strong>Joe Domanick: You use the term \"community efficacy\" when talking about community policing. What do you mean by that?<br></strong><strong>LAPD Chief Charlie Beck: </strong>We have to recognize what a strong factor the police [can be] in building communities. It's a huge responsibility to go into a community that has extreme issues with crime, lack of connection and cohesiveness, to [help solve those problems] and then give the people back their neighborhoods. I can flood any neighborhood with police officers and make it safe overnight. But what I want—and what I believe police can do—is build community [residents'] belief that they are in charge of their own destiny, and can make a difference in how and where they live. I believe that is the next revolution of policing. </p><p><strong>How do you do that?<br></strong>Our bureau chiefs, area captains, and senior lead officers are all involved – that's about 300 people. They are responsible for [everything from] crime to issues like abandoned couches—for everything in one piece of turf 24/7. And our area captains, through community policing, have total authority to affect quality of life and the way people feel about safety in their commands. </p><p> I'm proudest of our community safety partnerships in our housing developments, where officers are assigned not to make arrests but to build community. We pioneered that, and it's spreading throughout the city. Officers make a five-year commitment to stay there to make a difference in quality of life. And they are not judged on arrest numbers. They are judged on public safety overall, and on community cohesiveness. </p><p> We are going to start doing community surveys—not only city-wide, but community surveys in the various divisions, so we can compare and contrast and measure progress. So [evaluation won't just be based] on crime numbers, but on how people feel about us and public safety. </p><p><strong>Are there any changes, or any training you've been doing, to try to keep to the bare minimum officer-involved shootings and other police abuses?<br></strong>The organization has changed its philosophy dramatically—its internal philosophy, not just its external stated philosophy. This past summer, we put our entire operations force [about 86 percent of the LAPD] through 10 hours of preservation-of-life training. The focus was to reinforce the necessity to preserve human life as our primary objective. We are following that up now with many hours of scenario-based training, about 32 for the entire force. We did the philosophy, and we are now doing the application. </p><p>We now select people for success within the structure that we have created. I've been the chief almost seven years now, and Bratton was the chief for seven years before me. Literally, we have got two generations of cops. The vast majority of patrol cops were hired by me, [most of the rest by] Bratton. And [this structure is] all they have ever known. </p><p><strong>How has the police academy training changed in terms of your desires for community policing. As you know, Bratton gave a lot of officers, including yourself, kind of carte blanche to start to think about these things.<br></strong>We have changed the training in the last couple of years to be more all-inclusive. We don't silo our topics. We include de-escalation of force training and communications skills and everything that they do. I have a civilian employee with a doctorate in education that runs my academy. She is absolutely focused on making sure that we do as inclusive a job as we can with our recruits. </p><p>We've also begun to bring the academy classes later in their careers—at their one, two-and-a-half and five-year points [of service] for more in-service training on the exact topics we've been talking about. We believe that is the most effective way for them to learn, because they already are in the same learning group, with shared interests and experiences. </p><p>They already have a pecking order, and their social group is already done. In any kind of training, all those things have to get resolved before any learning occurs. So we are bringing them back and their academy cohorts for training on this exact topic. That is called the LAPD University. We are totally redoing the way that we look at in-service training, in order to apply the right kinds of lessons at the right time in their careers. </p><p><strong>One of raps against you from some within the LAPD is that your discipline is inconsistent. Do they have a point?<br></strong>Sometimes folks forget discipline is not solely based on the act. There are termination offenses no matter what kind of record you have. But discipline is certainly influenced by an officer's history. A person who makes a mistake over and over is going to receive much harsher discipline than somebody who makes it for the first time. </p><p><strong>What do you mean when you talk about a \"mistake of the heart\" and a \"mistake of the head\"?<br></strong>A mistake of the heart is malignant. Doing something with evil intent is very different than doing something because you made a poor decision with good intentions. A mistake of the heart is planting dope on somebody. A mistake of the head is miscounting narcotics when you book it and [us] finding out that [that the total is wrong.] Mistakes of the heart, I can't tolerate. Through training and reinforcement, a lot of the mistakes of the head can be rectified so they won't reoccur. </p><p><strong>Aren't there are some \"mistakes of the head\" that need to be strongly disciplined as an example to other officers?<br></strong>I do fire people for mistakes of the head. Drinking and driving is a mistake of the head. It is not because you have a malignant heart. I fire people for that to set an example. Not the first time but certainly the second time. </p><p><strong>In 2015, there were a number of LAPD shootings of the kind where you sit up on your TV couch and say, \"Wow! I can't believe they just shot that guy.\" Recently, you've sent to the DA the case of the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-shooting-venice-20150506-story.html\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">fatal LAPD shooting of Brandon Glenn</a> [a young, unarmed black man who was shot in the back in Venice, Ca.] with a recommendation to prosecute the officer. How does that differ from some of the other controversial LAPD officer-involved shootings? Is it a rare occurrence in this or any city for an officer to get referred for an indictment in a shooting incident?<br></strong>First of all, I have done this many times in other instances. I have [recommended] prosecuting police officers for murder and everything below that, as [an Internal Affairs] detective, and as chief, I've aggressively prosecuted police officers. Usually, that's not for actions conducted while on duty, (but) sometimes it is. Recently, we had a case prosecuted where an officer kicked somebody unnecessarily. That was captured on video. It didn't result in a death. I don't shy from that. I don't like prosecuting cops but that doesn't stop me from doing it. </p><p><strong>Nevertheless, the LAPD has a high rate of officer-involved shootings, compared to other police agencies.<br></strong>We make many, many contacts, and have maybe the most gang violence. There are consequences to that. When you have the most interactions and the most radio calls and the most arrests, you are going to have the most opportunities for [officer-involved] shootings. You can't compare us to an agency half our size and say, \"Why do you have more shootings?\" Of course we have more shootings. We have more of everything. </p><p>Then the other piece is we have a geographic or demographic that is more violent than others. Police are going to come in contact with that violence. And you are going to have an increase in police use of force. </p><p><strong>Why do officer-involved shootings take so long to adjudicate? One just took 13 months. Your critics say you're just taking your time until public outrage has settled and the incident is off everybody's mind.<br></strong>Should we adjudicate it before the autopsy is done? Autopsies take three to four months. Should we adjudicate them before all the witnesses' statements and everything else is done? We do homicide level investigations on every one of these [officer involved shootings]. Then after the investigations, the [LAPD] inspector general looks at them, [the department's] use-of-force board and the chief of police look at them, and then the police commission has to rule on them. And all of that takes time. They have to review 48 shootings [in 2015]  and multiple other uses of force. </p><p>Which part of this scenario do I skip? It was designed by the [1991 Warren]  <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo73.htm\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Commission</a> and the [US Justice Department's] consent decree, in response to what people saw as a department that was [out of] control. And we follow it scrupulously. </p><p><strong>Does the Los Angeles DA ever investigate LAPD officers without the recommendation of the department first?<br></strong>We present every officer-involved shooting to the DA for review. Every one of them. Others don't do that. No matter how good they are. They all go to the DA for review. And the DA responds as a roll out tape that goes to every officer involved shooting scene at the time it occurs and has for years. </p><p><strong>Before, if the LAPD didn't send it over to the DA's office, there wasn't any investigation.  It's not that way anymore?<br></strong>No. We send every one of them over there, and they are invited—we have DAs assigned to each one of the investigations. </p><p><strong>So if the DA wanted to, she could initiate—after you send it over—her own investigation and indict, even though the department is not asking for the indictment?<br></strong>Absolutely. </p><p><strong>If I were a police chief, I would talk about violence among poor African-American young men every day, and why nothing is being done except more repression and mass incarceration, in terms of long-term investment to remedy the situation.<br></strong>You're absolutely correct. A small minority of the population commit—and are victims of—the vast majority of crime.  Much of that is tied to circumstances of birth and race and many other things. [We're] about changing that dynamic. It's the hardest thing to do in policing. But if you create a sense of social efficacy and a belief that a community is in charge of its own destiny, you can reduce violence and crime. </p><p>I always struggle with how hard I am going to lean on the fact that 42 percent of our homicide victims are African Americans, [whose population is less than 9 percent of Los Angeles]; and 40 percent of the suspects arrested for homicide were African American. [But] just railing on why nobody will fix the problems in [our] poor communities—I don't know how much that will get me.  I think everybody understands [the causes]. </p><p><strong>But people don't understand that. It's been hard for many, many white people to grasp.<br></strong>Well, it's very true [about the circumstances]. We have to have the conversation about what is killing our youth—because that is what this is—our youth. We all have to recognize that some of our communities are much more prone to violence than others. And we've got to find a way to fix that. </p><p>But everybody [in a department] has to pull together. And [even then] everything we do can be unwound by one Neanderthal [cop] that treats people badly in the wrong situation. </p><p><strong>Well, I have come to understand that you've had to bring the troops along. And police unions are a powerfully resistant political force.<br></strong>Of course. That's why I get frustrated with my union when it goes hard right on some of these issues. I need the members to believe in [what we're trying to do], because that's how we'll get better, and maybe we'll become an example for America. Maybe. </p><p><strong>Is your department still doing roughly the same [high] number of stop and frisks?<br></strong>Well, I hate that term, of course. Our detentions are reduced, and our overall arrests have been part of a continuing decline. A lot of that is due to a de-emphasis through the courts and through law and even internally toward narcotics arrests and some other lower-level types of arrests that have caused those numbers to go down. Our stops have declined on a similar level, but we still make a lot of stops. There are still multiple hundreds of thousands of year. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><strong><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/las-police-chief-explains-how-he-gets-rid-of-dirty-cops-body-image-1457019545-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"2400\" data-original-height=\"1607\" data-model-id=\"152696\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"las-police-chief-explains-how-he-gets-rid-of-dirty-cops-body-image-1457019545.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></strong></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti with LAPD Chief Charlie Beck—who is wearing a body camera—at a press conference about the rollout of the agency's body camera program in September 2015.(Photo by Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)<br></p><p><strong>In our previous discussion for this interview, you were talking about how \"explanation\" in policing-stops goes a long way toward easing the tension during a stop. Your ability to articulate why you stopped somebody has a lot to do with how people feel about it.<br></strong>One of the great things about the body cameras and the in-car video is that supervisors are able to review that [interaction] period, and see how effective their officers are at it, and make adjustments. One of the reasons that we look at biased policing complaints so exhaustively is because I think that many of them are an exact symptom of this—of a lack of explanation. </p><p><strong>What do you want to get done during the remaining three years of your term?<br></strong>I want to get back on track with crime, be the model in building community trust, and get people to have faith in this police department to the extent that the national conversation [about how police abuse] may have damaged it. </p><p><strong>In terms of building community trust, how far along do you think the department currently is?<br></strong>I believe our police officers generally make excellent decisions on stopping the right people in the right circumstance. Do I put inexperienced people out there? Do I fish with a net? No. We try to be as targeted as possible. Fishing with a net is a very bad way to police. You may catch a lot of fish, but you certainly don't get the right kind. </p><p><strong>How difficult was it for you to pull all the interested parties together and come up with your plan?<br></strong>It was difficult.  Nobody is completely is satisfied with this.  Nobody. The ACLU, the Police Protective League [the LAPD union], the city council, and I are all not completely satisfied. But it's a workable compromise that allows police accountability and officer's confidence in a tool that is being used to not only monitor them but also support their work. </p><p>You've got a balance—I can make a system that's pure monitoring of officers, or a system that's pure prosecution, but we want something that [the officers] will use; that  allows for accountability; and will improve behavior on both sides of the camera and change the way cops perceive their jobs.  All of us are guilty of not being our best at all times. Cameras increase the likelihood that everybody will perform to their optimum capability. </p><p><strong>Two issues with the plan: The public doesn't get to see the videos of these controversial shootings, and the officers are allowed to view the video before they make their statement. These seem very problematic.<br></strong>Representatives of the public are allowed to see the videos. The police commission, the district attorney, the city attorney, and the [LAPD] inspector general all have full access to these videos. A video is a form of evidence, like a written statement, an oral recording, a photograph, or an autopsy. To release it out of context doesn't do justice to the investigation. These are raw videos, capturing a knot hole of an incident and not the totality of the circumstances. What we are looking for is not absolute transparency. It's accountability. </p><p>As for an officer being allowed to view the video before making a statement, shouldn't an officer when transcribing his report be able to review it, so that [he or she] can make the most accurate statement based on a report he created? </p><p><strong>Or critics might suggest officers can make a statement that's most favorable to them when based on the video.<br></strong><strong>T</strong>he evidence [the video] is what the evidence is. You can't change it by your statement. If you have acted inappropriately or improperly, the evidence in the video will generally show that. We're trying to create a tool that officers will use and embrace and adds a level of accountability. So there are compromises made. The addition of video is no different than the many other pieces of evidence that officers are allowed to view before making their statements. We do a walk-through so they can see the scene [of the incident]. </p><p>Being involved in a shooting is very traumatic. We are trying to get their best recollection. If the investigators decide that is not the best way to do it than we don't. In the Venice shooting (of Brandon Glenn), the officer involved hasn't seen that tape, because I thought it was a criminal act [when I viewed it.] </p><p><strong>Let's talk about the huge homeless problem in the city of Los Angeles, and how it's essentially been left to the LAPD to deal with for decades.<br></strong>The best thing about this year is that finally other people are [also] taking responsibility for it. [Mayor] Eric Garcetti has done a phenomenal job of bringing people together. [LA's] government is so decentralized and power is so dispersed that it's very difficult to get things done without building a consensus. But he's brought [Los Angeles] County [toward reform] along, and the county [controls] all the mental health services and the majority of the money for housing and other services. </p><p>We've been locked in a spiral going the wrong way on this. We had to claim a 14 percent increase in the [number] of homeless living on the street last year. Visually,  it looks like double that, and that's a huge crime issue for us. I mean, our number one division in crime increase this year was Central [Division, in Downtown LA, including Skid Row]. And damn near all of that is homeless on homeless crime. </p><p><strong>So what's the new plan?<br></strong>Creating more homeless housing and incentives for people to want to live in that housing. We have vacant beds every night [in Skid-Row facilities]. So people need to be willing to go to [homeless housing]. And the department [has been developing] mental health teams—\"smart teams\" of a mental health provider and a police officer that respond to not only calls about the mentally ill but also do case work on the homeless and mentally ill. </p><p><strong>How many officers are working on that?<br></strong>I am adding 32, and I had 40. That's a big commitment. And the Department of Mental Health has agreed to add 30 more [of its personnel]. We are going to be handling almost 70 percent of our mental health calls with those teams. We can fix this problem with enough energy, commitment, and funding. It's not fixed now, but things are lining up and maybe we can make some progress. </p><p><strong>LA has a long history of combative LAPD chiefs like Ed Davis, Daryl Gates, and Bernard Parks who warred with the media and other critics, and made the LAPD all about themselves. Even Bill Bratton, who courted the press and public, made the department about \"Bill Bratton the Reformer.\" You, on the other hand, have kept a remarkably low profile. Why?<br></strong>The chief of police should not be everybody's focus of interest. My ideal scenario is having a police department that [the public] believes in more than it believes in the chief. I have got a finite time [in office], a goodbye date. I have to create an organization that will continue [to get better]. We made huge progress in Bratton's administration and hopefully in mine; I want that to [pass that on] to the next chief. </p><p><em>A version of this story was originally published in the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimereport.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Crime Report</a>.<br></em> </p><p><em><a href=\"http://johnjayresearch.org/cmcj/about/joe-domanick/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Domanick</a> is West Coast bureau chief of the Crime Report, and associate director of the Center on Media, Crime, and Justice at John Jay College in NYC.

The goal is to reduce the backlog in Manhattan Criminal Court, which officials <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/nyregion/summonses-not-arrests-for-small-crimes-in-manhattan.html\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em> could drop by about 10,000 cases per year.</p><p>To be sure, pissing in public, along with making unreasonable amounts of noise and littering and other petty offenses targeted by \"broken windows\" policing, remains illegal. But instead of being arrested, most violators will now be asked to appear before a judge and answer questions. The judge can then decide whether to dismiss the case or impose a penalty.</p><p>The joint decision between the New York Police Department (NYPD) and Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance preempts a broader proposed change to policing in New York. In January, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/is-new-york-city-about-to-ease-up-on-petty-bs-crimes\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2016; if passed, it would give cops the discretion to hand out either civil penalties or (criminal) summonses, as called for under the new Manhattan policy, for low-level offenses. The law would require agencies like the Parks Department to amend the way it deals with violators within its jurisdictions.</p><p>Either way, this new trend in NYC policing <em>should</em> allow officers to focus more on serious, violent crimes and less on paperwork for minor, goofy ones. But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/nyregion/new-york-city-to-transform-the-summons-process-for-courts-and-recipients.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">critics say</a> summonses can be overused–– partially because they are so easy to hand out––and disproportionately affect poor communities that are over-policed. After all, under both the new Manhattan policy and the proposed city-wide law, if you have a warrant out for your arrest, you will still be detained. And critics say many people of color get slapped with warrants after failing to appear for petty BS raps.</p><p>Instead, some police reformers hope the city-wide conversation about criminal backlog will lead to wider, more systemic changes when it comes to who gets pegged for, say, illegally riding a bike on the sidewalk.</p><p>\"We would like to see police policies changed to eliminate the disparate treatment of communities of color,\" Seymour W. James Jr., the attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society, told the <em>Times.</em></p><p><em>Follow Allie Conti on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allie_conti\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><em><br></em></p>",

You wouldn't get it now. It was a good thing them days.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Bob moved to Becontree with his parents and two siblings back in 1929, he was just five years old. His father had been transferred from Battersea Power Station to Barking Power Station, so his family left south London for the suburbs of Dagenham. The area they moved to was one of the most impressive public housing estates ever built in Britain. From 1921 to 1934, 29,000 homes were constructed in Becontree as part of a housing program designed to reward soldiers returning from the First World War and stave off the threat of Bolshevism, which was a pressing concern for the inter-war British elite. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The repetitive rows of pebbledash terraced houses with front and back yards are hard to miss. In terms of population it was, and still is, the biggest public housing estate in the world. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"It was something totally different,\" says Bob, who has spent nearly his entire life on the estate and married his neighbor in 1947. \"Something nice and fresh and new. It must have been a blessing for mum and dad because they weren't used to that sort of thing: a nice house to go to and live in, decent toilets, decent facilities, a roof over their heads. People had never been so well off... they lived in slums before.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855720-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"812\" data-model-id=\"151855\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855720.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Bob.

According to the government, the new bill will help tackle the housing crisis and transform \"generation rent into generation buy.\" Hidden within a long  <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0087/16087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> full of technical jargon are policies that could, some say, spell the end of public housing altogether. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A new system called pay-to-stay will force tenants earning above £30,000 [$40,000] (or £40,000 [$56,000] in London) to pay full market rent for their property, purchase it under right-to-buy or leave altogether. Lifetime tenancies, the right to live in the same place for life, will be scrapped. Homes considered to be high-value will be sold off once they become vacant and the proceeds given to housing association tenants, who will be offered their homes under right-to-buy. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Put together, the new policies have been  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/23/ministers-want-to-get-rid-of-social-housing-former-civil-service-chief-to-say?CMP=share_btn_tw\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> by Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, as a \"grand theft of the public realm\" and \"another nail in the coffin of the post-war settlement.\" By the end of the 1970s, 42 percent of the population lived in social housing. It was, for many, an achievement comparable to the National Health Service. Today, just under 8 percent rent from the state. The era of government-provided, affordable housing that offered people like Bob the chance of building a better life has been gradually replaced by a new housing crisis with endless waiting lists, a dysfunctional private rented sector, and a society obsessed by a dream of homeownership that for most will never come true. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456843435-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151759\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456843435.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Hurley House on the Boundary Estate. Photo by Jake Lewis </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It's midday and the sun shines down on the pitched roofs and red bricks of the Boundary Estate in Shoreditch, east London. Just 150 feet from the busy high street, things are remarkably quiet: a few locals mill around the community launderette and a few others sit in the estate's small, raised park. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If she cranes her neck from the window of her ground floor apartment, Jean Locker can just about make out where the residents of a slum called the Old Nichol would once have lived. For the 67-year-old nursery worker, it's a point of deep personal significance. She moved to the Boundary Estate as a tenant over 30 years ago, but it was only recently she discovered her great-great-grandmother, a Huguenot clothes dealer, had actually lived in the slum over 100 years earlier. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"They called it the 'blackest streets' because of the high crime and high poverty,\" she says referring to a map by Charles Booth that used black as an indication of poverty. \"A lot of the problems here were caused by the deteriorating housing, the slum landlords, the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rachman\" target=\"_blank\">Rachminites</a> of the Victorian time, who let their houses go into a decrepit state.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Completed in 1900 by architects at London City Council (LCC) over a slum known as the Old Nichol, the Boundary Estate was the first public housing estate to be built in Britain. Prior to this, the only real attempt to rehouse the urban poor had been inadequate attempts by private philanthropists and social reformers such as American banker George Peabody. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456843231-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151757\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456843231.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Arnold Circus bandstand, built from the rubble of the Old Nichol slum. Photo by Jake Lewis </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We're sitting on a small bench next to a green and brown band stand built from the actual rubble of the Old Nichol slum. Looking at the arts-and-crafts-influenced blocs fanning out from around us, it's striking just how good the Boundary Estate looks after all this time. What is it like, living in a place of such social significance? <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I'm proud of the fact that I live somewhere a little bit unusual,\" she says. \"I really want to know exactly where things were. I'd like to be standing on that same spot (she was).\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Locker came from an old house in Hackney with \"no toilet inside, no hot water, a leaking roof, and no bath,\" so moving into the Boundary estate was a stark improvement. But back in 1900, when the trailblazers moved in, not everyone was so lucky. Despite an early commitment to the idea that society should house those in need, the universal aspect that came to be associated with mass public housing was yet to exist. The Boundary Estate—much like Becontree—was designed for the 'deserving poor,' those from certain trades and professions that could afford the rents being set. Only a tiny fraction of the Old Nichol's residents were actually allowed to live in the estate their slum had been cleared for. Mass public housing still wasn't on the cards. It would take another war to change that. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855784-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151856\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855784.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">The Aylesbury Estate. Photo by Jake Lewis </p><p>In his 2012 book <i>Concretopia: A Journey Around the Rebuilding of Postwar Britain, </i> John Grindrod tells the story of British public housing during its most interesting, exciting, and intense phases. During the Blitz, two million homes were destroyed by German air raids, many in the same industrial cities where housing conditions for the working class were already bad. In response, the 1945 Labour government, led by Clement Attlee, showed a commitment to building public housing that surpassed anything before it. By 1951, over 900,000 homes had been completed. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Grindrodgrew up in New Addington, a large post-war housing estate in Croydon, but it never really occurred to him to find out what this period of history entailed until he left the area at age 30. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"It's kind of impossible to overstate how optimistic, excited, and proud people were to be doing that work at that time,\" he tells me from a pub in Forest Hill, not far from where he grew up. \"When I interviewed architects and planners about it they would melt a bit. They would get so misty-eyed and immediately slightly heartbroken, having seen that attitude disappear. There was this sense that they'd been talking about building and planning this stuff for ages, but they'd only been able to tinker around the edges, and now they could actually do something proper about these problems. They really were trying to create a better world.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over the next three decades, local authorities responded to the country's housing needs with a staggering array of different ideas and architectural styles. There were modest pre-fabricated huts built as part of a temporary, emergency building program. There was the New Towns Act in 1946 that aimed to tackle overcrowding in inner cities by building 29 entirely new areas. There were high-rise concrete apartments, streets in the sky, and competing styles like New Brutalism and New Empiricism. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The idea that post-war council housing is all the same is just total nonsense,\" Grindrod says. \"Where I grew up, there were semi-detached houses, low-rise flats, a couple of high-rise flats, early permanent two-story prefabs. Everything was going on in that place. I'm constantly surprised when I go and visit places at how different they are from one another.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Politics got in the way. \"There was this race between the Tories and Labour to build more housing as quickly as possible,\" says Grindrod. \"That meant everyone cut corners and nobody did proper checks. They just wanted to get the numbers up and reach the targets they had set. The only way they could do that though was to build things with prefabrication [assembled in a factory] and unskilled labor.\" <o:p></o:p> <!--recommended--> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the May 16, 1968, a gas explosion at Ronan Point in Newham killed four, injured 11, and exposed just how bad some of the shoddily constructed prefabricated towers erected in this period were. Though responsibility for what happened lay with dodgy building companies and corrupt local authorities, the implications were felt far and wide. According to architecture critic Edwin Heathcote, the investigation that followed Ronan Point's collapse caused \"irreparable damage to the image of public housing, the construction industry, and to modernist architecture itself.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fast-forward a few decades, and under New Labour, there was an image problem facing British public housing. Tower blocks became sink estates and tenants became lazy, rude mooches. It was no longer about the odd badly designed building—the whole idea behind public housing was being systematically discredited. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">One man who remains particularly vocal in his criticism of what got built in the post-war period is Nicholas Boys Smith, founder of Create Streets—a controversial social enterprise that campaigns for low-rise, terraced housing and apartments. In 2013, Boys Smith—formerly a managing director at Lloyds Banking Group—co-authored <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/create%20streets.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> with Alex Morton from the right-wing think-tank Policy Exchange that blamed high-rise estates for a litany of social problems including juvenile delinquency, crime, poor relationships with neighbors, and even suicide.  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Though well intentioned, many post-war developments—council housing or otherwise—were very poorly set out,\" Boys Smith tells me over the phone. \"Big buildings cost more to run, are less flexible, tend to be less environmentally friendly and have high charges involved in their management. They were also built in a way we now increasingly understand means less good wellbeing outcomes for residents. They created very physically disparate estates which, pretty quickly in most cases, started going wrong.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The solution, according to Boys Smith and Morton, is the \"replacement of London's multi-story housing... with real houses in real streets.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The research is pretty unambiguous,\" Boys Smith says. \"On the whole, living in a house or a smaller building nearer the ground with a front door to the street, a bit of private space and access to green space in a way that you can control—these things tend to be correlated with being happier with where you live, lower crime, and better social links between neighbors. It's also quite popular and therefore achieves high values.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If there's one estate that would seem to exemplify this idea of \"urban decline\" it ought to be the Aylesbury Estate in south London—the largest system-built estate in the city, constructed with vast grey slabs of prefabricated concrete. By the time Aylesbury was completed in 1977, the damage to the reputation of post-war modernism had already been done. Two decades later, Tony Blair made his first speech as Prime Minister on the estate, in which he referred to its residents as \"forgotten people.\" Filmmakers would regularly flock to the area for its \"gritty\" aesthetic and journalists would use it as shorthand for inner-city crime and poverty. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456842599-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151751\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456842599.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Aysen Dennis.

She describes herself as \"the official face\" of an anti-gentrification occupation that took place here last year and rejects outright the stigma that has surrounded her community. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"These were all fabricated things to make the estate look bad,\" she says, matter-of-factly. \"I witnessed the children grow up in front of my eyes and turn into decent young adults. I live here as a woman and I've never come across anything that wouldn't happen elsewhere. This is the place I've felt the safest anywhere in my life.\"  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dennis' level of anger and willingness to resist the current demolition effort through direct action is striking. Given her personal circumstances it's also unsurprising. In 1988, eight years after a military coup, Dennis left her home in Turkey to escape political repression. For the next five years she moved around London, living in friends' houses, squats, and a cooperative in Camberwell which she left because of racist abuse. When her application for an apartment back in 1993 was successful, years of exhausting instability appeared to have come to an end. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456856048-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151858\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456856048.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">The Aylesbury estate.

It was the first time I had a place that was truly my own. Growing up, my father was in the army, so we used to move around a lot and I was never able to stay in the same place for a long time. I always envied people that could do that. When I moved here I felt this was it: this is my place and I'm going to live and die here.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the end, for Dennis, the estate's fall from grace says far less about the failure of British modernism and far more about the desire to release the real-estate potential of inner-city London. She thinks the estate was deliberately run down by a government that wants to cash in, and looking out through the large windows of her warm, bright apartment, it's easy to see why. To the left is Burgess Park, one of the largest green spaces south of the river, and to the right, in the distance, you can make out the London Eye slowly turning for the city's tourists. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"They think we don't deserve it,\" she adds. \"It makes me so angry that they measure our humanity according to how much money we have in a bank account.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><hr><p><strong><em>Related: Watch '<a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_us/video/backstreet-abortions-in-the-philippines-year-of-mercy\" target=\"_blank\">Year of Mercy</a>' our new documentary about backstreet abortions in the Philippines</em></strong><br> </p><iframe src=\"//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&aid=vice.com/the-vice-report&vid=F3eGhkMTE69WveDrHx749kIqnuvJV8rp&embedCode=F3eGhkMTE69WveDrHx749kIqnuvJV8rp&cust_params=embdom%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_uk%2Fvideo%2Fbackstreet-abortions-in-the-philippines-year-of-mercy%26topic%3D%26aid%3Dbackstreet-abortions-in-the-philippines-year-of-mercy%26auth%3D%26keywords%3DPhilippines%2Ccontraception%2CAbortion%2CReproductive+Health+Bill%2CCatholics%2CCatholicism%2CWomen%26%2339%3Bs+Health%26ac%3Dyes%26country%3Den_uk%26contentId%3DF3eGhkMTE69WveDrHx749kIqnuvJV8rp&ad_rule=1&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_uk%2Fvideo%2Fbackstreet-abortions-in-the-philippines-year-of-mercy&autoplay=0&share_url=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/video/backstreet-abortions-in-the-philippines-year-of-mercy\" width=\"640px\" height=\"360px\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"> </iframe><p><strong><em><br></em></strong> </p><hr><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Last week Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London, said he had an \"ethical obligation\" to demolish London's public housing estates, citing research by  <a href=\"http://pdf.euro.savills.co.uk/uk/residential---other/completing-london-s-streets-080116.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Savills</a> that was compiled with input from Create Streets. A few weeks earlier David Cameron announced a proposal to demolish or overhaul 100 so-called \"sink estates\" and replace them with low-rise housing. Sitting on a  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-launches-panel-of-experts-to-kick-start-estates-regeneration\" target=\"_blank\">17-strong panel</a> that will work on that proposal and develop a \"national estate regeneration strategy\" is none other than Nicholas Boys Smith. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, helping Cameron devise his wider housing strategy after leaving Policy Exchange to work as a Downing Street special advisor is Alex Morton. Many of the policies outlined in the bill including the forced sale of housing voids appear to have been lifted directly from Morton's  <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/ending%20expensive%20social%20tenancies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">other work</a> with Policy Exchange.<o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the new legislation will have implications far beyond the capital, according to research by Shelter, it's in central London where the impact on housing stock could be felt the worst. In Camden, for example, 11,714 homes, nearly 50 percent of its total stock, fall above the bill's \"high value threshold.\" And that's in a borough with a waiting list that was, until a recent  <a href=\"http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/camden_council_throws_23_000_people_off_waiting_list_for_council_house_1_4165825\" target=\"_blank\">change</a> to its housing allocation policy, 30,000 people deep. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456842528-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151750\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456842528.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Dorian Courtesi. Photo by Philip Kleinfeld </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">From 48-year-old Dorian Courtesi's lounge on the third floor of Barrington Court in Gospel Oak, you can hear the loud sound of construction work on a private new-build across the road. Just a stone's throw from Hampstead Heath, Barrington Court is right in the middle of some of Camden's most valuable land.  Should any of the estate's more expensive two- and three-bedroom street-level apartments become vacant, Courtesi fears they will be sold off in an instant. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I think it's atrocious,\" he says. \"We've got families on waiting lists. On this estate, we have a woman and a partner with two young daughters under the age of five living in a one bedroom property.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855961-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"151857\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/01/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/01/\" data-image-filename=\"philip-kleinfeld-council-housing-planning-bill-body-image-1456855961.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Barrington Court. Photo by Jake Lewis </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even more worrying are the new pay-to-stay rules, which Courtesi estimates could affect between 25 and 30 percent of the residents.  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Back and neck problems mean he can only work part-time at the moment, but should his circumstances change, he too could be affected. \"Say my pay rate went up from £38,000 [$53,000] to just over £40,000 [$56,000],\" he says. \"I would be in a situation where I was paying more out in rent as a social housing tenant if my pay grade goes up. How does that incentivize me to improve my circumstances as a person in the labor market?\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The housing bill passed through Parliament, but resistance is beginning to build. In March, peers in the House of Lords  <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0087/amend/087-List-2-Feb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> over 100 amendments including plans to block pay-to-stay, the end of secure tenancy, and the sell-off of housing association property and high-value homes. A vote on that will take place in March. Meanwhile, a new campaign called Kill the Housing Bill—Secure Homes for All has been set up by a coalition of different groups, including Camden Assembly of Tenants, of which Courtesi is a member. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether it will be enough to affect the content of the bill remains to be seen. Just before Courtesi leaves his apartment to join a group of activists planning a large demonstration in central London, I ask him whether he believes the purpose of the bill really is to destroy public housing once and for all. \"Yes I do,\" he says, without a second's hesitation. It's a question which could seal the fate of places like Becontree, Boundary Estate, and Aylesbury. <o:p></o:p> </p><p><em>Follow Philip on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PKleinfeld\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter.</a> </em> </p><p><em>Follow Jake on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jake_Photo\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><!--EndFragment-->",

By the time <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/super-tuesday-put-the-republican-party-one-step-closer-to-being-ruled-by-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump and Ted Cruz delivered closing remarks</a> to their respective conservative fans, their Democratic counterparts had long gone home. Hours earlier, soon after the first polls had closed, most media outlets had quickly announced their projections in that race, predicting big wins for Hillary Clinton across most of the 12 states that cast ballots for Democrats on Tuesday.</p><p>On one of the most decisive nights of the presidential race so far, Clinton scored resounding victories over her democratic socialist rival Bernie Sanders in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and her former stomping grounds in Arkansas. In Massachusetts—one of the few states where the results were close—she edged out Sanders by just a few points. Sanders, meanwhile, managed to take Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado, and his home state of Vermont—a strong showing, but not nearly strong enough to diminish Clinton's aura of inevitability.</p><p>Crucially, the results translated into a <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/delegates/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s2\">huge delegate haul for Clinton</span></a>, pulling her a tiny bit closer to the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination. In one night, the former secretary of state nearly quadrupled her delegate tally to 544, while her opponent trailed with 349—and those totals don't include the party's \"superdelegates,\" the overwhelming majority of whom are backing Clinton.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The key test for Clinton Tuesday was whether she could activate the broad coalition of voters who rejected her eight years ago—the so-called \"Obama coalition\" comprised of black and Latino voters who make up a huge bloc of the Democratic primary electorate, especially in the South. In the end, she crushed that test, beating Sanders by huge margins in states like Georgia, where she pulled in nearly three-quarters of the vote. </span></p><p>It wasn't the routing many would have predicted when Sanders first got in the race last spring, but Clinton seemed satisfied with the results—satisfied enough, at least, to dispense of attacks against her rival and turn her attention toward juicier, general election targets. After weeks of hammering Sanders at post-primary rallies, Clinton zeroed in on the Republican Party on Tuesday, previewing a general election message against her likely GOP rival Donald Trump.</p><p>\"It might be unusual for a presidential candidate to say this, but I'm going to keep saying this: I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness,\" she told a jubilant crowd at a victory party in Florida. \"Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.\"  </p><p>Sanders, meanwhile, was hemmed in by demographics once again, unable to expand his appeal beyond the white liberals and young millennial \"Berners\" who have fueled his dark horse campaign. Although the Vermont senator showed no signs of backing out Tuesday night, his remarks at a victory rally in his home state on Tuesday seemed to tacitly acknowledge that the race probably isn't going to end with him in the White House.</p><p>\"I know that Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I don't think so,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"What I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about making a political revolution.\" What he left out, however, is that the prospect of that revolution had just gotten a little bit dimmer.</p><p><em>Follow John Surico on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnSurico\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter.</em></a></p>",

A lot has been written about Trump's appeal among these voters, especially the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-working-class-voters_us_56aa44d0e4b0d82286d51ffa\" target=\"_blank\">working-class white ones</a>, but his whole campaign can best be summed up in two words: <em>Fuck you</em>. He's on track to win the GOP nomination because a lot of people have been getting screwed by the machine for years, and they believe Donald Trump is the guy who can screw the machine back.</p><p>On the Republican side, the Super Tuesday results were pretty unambiguous. Trump won at least 40 percent of the vote in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and Massachusetts, and eked out closer wins in Virginia, Arkansas, and Vermont. According to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/super-tuesday-exit-polls/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a CNN exit poll</a>, the results were fueled by large numbers of GOP voters who said they were dissatisfied with the government and who, perhaps more tellingly, felt they'd been \"betrayed\" by the their own party. </p><p>Virginia was perhaps the most significant win for Trump, extending his routing to a state where Marco Rubio—who's become the de facto standard-bearer for the Republican Establishment—was supposed to be able to compete. The Florida senator did come close, with 32 percent of the Virginia GOP vote to Trump's 35, but it didn't come close to making up for his third-place finishes in the rest of the South. Rubio's only win of the night—and first of the 2016 election cycle—was in Minnesota, which hardly amounts to a win at all. </p><p>Ted Cruz, on the other hand, managed to hold his home state of Texas, and he also scored wins in neighboring Oklahoma and Alaska, making him the surprising comeback story of the night. It wasn't quite the Super Tuesday sweep his campaign had planned, but it was enough for the Texas senator to call on the other remaining non-Trump candidates to drop out so he can put an end to The Donald.</p><p>\"So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,\" Cruz told the elated crowd at his primary night party in Stafford, Texas. \"We are the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump once, twice, three times.\"<br></p><p>The remarks were clearly aimed at Rubio. Problem is, Cruz's Republican colleagues generally <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/ted-cruzs-biggest-challenge-to-know-him-is-to-hate-him\" target=\"_blank\">despise him</a>, if only just slightly less than they hate Trump. So far, the rest of the candidates are still refusing to drop out. Rubio has a lot of endorsements and hopes to pick up a lot of delegates in his home state of Florida's winner-take-all contest later this month; and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who finished second in Vermont and has also yet to win a state, is apparently sticking around to see what happens in Michigan and Ohio. Ben Carson is also hanging around, possibly because he just doesn't have anything better to do.</p><p>As the logjam demonstrates, Trump's rise and continued dominance wasn't inevitable—it represents a massive institutional failure on the part of the Republican Party. For years, right-wing infotainers have been telling viewers and listeners <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/how-the-conservative-movement-enabled-donald-trumps-rise/470727/\" target=\"_blank\">not to trust</a> experts, politicians, or any sort of established authority. Then, when the GOP base inevitably embraced the most anti-establishment candidate out there, an anti–free trade pseudo-fascist who rejects the rules of political discourse, the Establishment failed to agree on a strategy to stop him. One way to frame it is that the insiders have lost control of the Republican Party—another is to just admit that there is no such thing as the Republican Party anymore, just a lot of white people angry at the way the world is turning.</p><p>Unable to channel the base's rage, prominent GOP leaders denounced Trump in every way they knew how in the days leading up to Super Tuesday. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/02/25/peak-lindsey-graham-trump-is-a-nut-job-loser-as-a-person-and-ill-suited-to-be-president/\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> him \"generally a loser as a person and a candidate\"; <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/29/a-vote-for-donald-trump-is-a-vote-for-bigotry.html\" target=\"_blank\">political consultant Stuart Stevens</a>, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, wrote Monday that it is \"impossible to pretend that Trump is not only an idiot but also a racist idiot\" and that \"he's proven he's a uniquely ugly figure to emerge in American political history.\" </p><p>But by now it's clear that Trump voters don't care what people like Graham and Stevens have to say—their comments just prove that their candidate is hated by the right sort of people. So far, no op-ed or anti-Trump <em>cri de coeur</em> has made a difference, not even John Oliver's <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/29/john-oliver-destroys-donald-trump-you-are-either-a-racist-or-you-are-pretending-to-be.html\" target=\"_blank\">heavily googled \"Donald Drumpf\" takedown</a>. The GOP's big-money donors <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-megadonors-219690\" target=\"_blank\">haven't done much to fund</a> Trump attack ads, either because it's too late to stop him or because negative press simply doesn't hurt him. Calling Trump a con man, or an authoritarian snake-oil salesman with a racist streak and a marked disinterest in the business of governing isn't an insult—it's his brand.</p><p>What often isn't said in all the Trump-bashing, though, is that he's right about some of the ways that Americans have been mistreated by their elites. NAFTA, which Trump has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-donald-trump-right-to-call-nafta-a-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> a \"disaster,\" really did <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">fuck over</a> ordinary workers. Letting Medicare <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/1/26/10835000/trump-medicare-drug-prices\" target=\"_blank\">negotiate drug prices</a> really would save a lot of taxpayer money at the expense of Big Pharma. (Incidentally, those are positions typically voiced by left-wing politicians.) He really is saying things that he can say only because he's not courting the donors other candidates have to kowtow to. But it says something about America—something not very nice—that in response to these actual problems, Republican voters are embracing a candidate whose most prominent positions involve keeping brown people out of the country. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/704795035070570498\" target=\"_blank\">One exit poll</a> found that six in ten Republican voters on Super Tuesday favored banning Muslims who weren't citizens from entering the US.)</p><p>So what happens now? According to the <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/super-tuesday-results/\" target=\"_blank\">latest AP tallies</a>, Trump has locked up 285 delegates, compared to 160 for Cruz and 87 for Rubio. Republican candidates need 1,237 delegates to win the party's nomination, and with several winner-take-all states set to vote later this month, it looks like Trump is well on his way to achieving that number. Conservative business leaders are now finally <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/super-tuesday-2016-elections/republican-donors-look-to-raise-money-to-stop-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">talking about</a> bombarding the reality-TV mogul with negative ads, and GOP strategists are reportedly trying to scheme up a way to thwart his coronation at the national convention this summer.</p><p>Some conservative politicians, meanwhile, seem to have read the writing on the wall and decided that maybe Trump isn't so bad after all. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/chris-christie-once-mocked-donald-trump-for-youre-fired-fame-now-hes-endorsing-him\" target=\"_blank\">made the leap</a> before Super Tuesday, and opened for Trump at his press conference on primary night, but he won't be the last. If Republicans can't beat Trump, sooner or later, they're going to have to join him.</p><p><em>Follow Harry Cheadle on <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/chris-christie-once-mocked-donald-trump-for-youre-fired-fame-now-hes-endorsing-him\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",

Once he gets back on solid ground, Kelly's flesh sack will be <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/twins-study/\" target=\"_blank\">studied by NASA</a> and compared to that of his twin brother to see if space has turned Kelly's bones to jelly or given him space madness or something.</p>",
