As the title suggests, we're talking about unmarried <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/tag/women\">women</a> in America, a group that is growing at an exponential rate. \"Wherever you find increasing numbers of single women in history, you find change,\" writes Traister. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The expansion of the population of unmarried women across classes signals a social and political rupture as profound as the invention of birth control, as the sexual revolution, as the abolition of slavery,\" the author explains. In other words, if history is any indication, we should expect dramatic change in America now, and Traister details why through a mixture of historical analysis, heavy research, personal anecdotes, and interviews with academics, social scientists, and both non-famous and prominent single women, such as Anita Hill and Gloria Steinem. <!--recommended--> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">While rates of unmarried women are at a new high (single women outnumbered married women for the first time in 2009, and today only 20 percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 are wed), they aren't a new phenomenon, and, historically, whenever women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, significant societal change followed. Most of the women who led the fights for abolition and suffrage, against lynching, and for secondary education, were unmarried—as were the women who pioneered new fields such as nursing and medicine.</p><p><i>All the Single Ladies</i> also dispels myths about unmarried women, from <i>Newsweek's</i> infamous <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/marriage-numbers-110797\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a><wbr> in 1986 that single women at age 40 were more likely to be killed by terrorists than get married, to the notion that women have achieved true equality in the 21st century. A  <a href=\"http://nymag.com/author/rebecca%20traister/\">New York Magazine writer-at-large</a> and <i>ELLE</i> contributing editor, Traister expertly paints a modern portrait of American life and how we got here, with an intersectional approach that accounts for class, race, and sexual orientation. Even more impressive is how Traister pushes a feminist agenda without the book ever feeling like it has an agenda, or that it's pointing the finger at the reader to make him or her feel guilty. VICE talked to Traister about <em>All the Single Ladies </em>over the phone and through email in light of its release. </p><hr><p><strong><em>For more on marriage, watch our doc on America's lucrative divorce industry:</em></strong> </p><iframe src=\"//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&aid=vice.com/love-industries&vid=czcWU4dTpRuNm20380Fk1imKbOPQfLk6&embedCode=czcWU4dTpRuNm20380Fk1imKbOPQfLk6&cust_params=embdom%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fheartbreak-hustle-923%26topic%3Dstuff%26aid%3Dheartbreak-hustle-923%26auth%3DAdri+Murguia%26keywords%3DMarriage%2Cdivorce%2Cbreak+up%2Clawyer%2Cindustry%2Clove%2Cwedding%2Csplit%2Cconscious+uncoupling%2Cparty%2Cdivorce+lawyer%2Cmoney%2Cexpensive%2Cbreaking+up%2CLove+Industries%2CVICE+UK%2CVICE+US%26ac%3Dno%26country%3Den_us%26contentId%3DczcWU4dTpRuNm20380Fk1imKbOPQfLk6&ad_rule=1&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fheartbreak-hustle-923&autoplay=0&share_url=http://www.vice.com/video/heartbreak-hustle-923\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360px\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"> </iframe><hr><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>VICE: What was your initial goal in writing  <i>All the Single Ladies </i> and how did it change or evolve during the research process?<br></strong><strong>Traister</strong>: My initial idea was that the book would be mostly contemporary journalism—mostly the interviews with single women, across ages, backgrounds, races, religions—about their experiences of being single. As I started researching, I became much more interested in the history of single women in America, and how profoundly they'd shaped the set of possibilities now open to today's single women. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What were some of the most interesting experiences you had during the research process? <br></strong>I think that coming across some of the published commentary of the 19th and early 20th centuries—from Susan B. Anthony's  <a href=\"http://leavesofgrass.org/SingleWomen.html\">Homes of Single Women</a> speech, to a 1904 newspaper column railing against the inequities of marriage, published by a \"Bachelor Maid\"—opened my eyes about how long these issues and questions and tensions have been in play, and how out in the open they've been. I still think of questioning marriage's primacy as a contemporary and rebellious act, but women have been doing it for centuries in really bold, funny, resonant ways. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Also, learning the stories of women who came up with ingenious ways of expressing their ambivalence about marriage, from Amelia Earhart, who wrote this incredibly ambivalent letter to her husband on their wedding day, to Lucy Stone, who published a proclamation of her ambivalence about marriage and its gender inequities and had the pastor at her wedding read it out loud. It's just so bracing and remarkable learning about women who have done remarkable things to evade the traps that marriage historically set for them.  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>You make the point that most American women, across all racial and ethnic groups, do eventually marry; they are just marrying later. How is late marriage benefitting women and society on the whole? <br></strong>It gets us a lot close to egalitarian marriage. I think the bigger patterns means that men and women live independently in the world, often alongside each other as colleagues, peers, and friends. By the time they join in marriage, you wind up with a far greater likelihood that they both know how to do their laundry and use a drill and have some economic stability. So when they do [get married], the pattern of responsibility won't fall on these old patriarchal lines that cut men off from being domestically involved. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>But we are constantly fed the narrative that high-achieving, successful women—particularly black women—will have a harder time finding a mate, when in reality, these high-achieving women are most likely to marry. Why is that? <br></strong>That's a very old trope. We've had women be dependent on men in this country and if there is this shift, it can be destabilizing. As a result, we send a lot of messages that it's a very bad thing. The message that you're going to \"independent\" your way to singlehood, especially to black women, is designed, consciously or not, to herd women back into more traditional emotional and legal setups. The point is to make you doubt the things you're doing independently, whether it's going to graduate school or having a baby on your own. The message is:  <i>get back.</i> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Staying single or marrying late can be hugely empowering for women, but what are some of the challenges these women experience, particularly poor women and women of color? <br></strong>Single women and single mothers, in particular, are much more likely to live at or below the poverty line than their married counterparts and single life in working class and low income communities is intensely hard. We have such a low minimum wage and no kinds of protections like paid leave or high-quality subsidized day care. We have a criminal justice system that incarcerates and kills black men at such higher rates. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are all kinds of systemic things that make life, including married and family life and childfree life, dramatically more challenging and difficult for low-income women and men. The idea that marrying someone, anyone, is going to help—and conservatives push this all the time—is wrong. One of the most economically devastating things in life is divorce. The solution is not marriage. Rather, we should be providing paid leave, a higher minimum wage, subsidized day care, a better health system, and lifting some of the limits on reproductive freedom. Marriage by itself does not address what is so grindingly difficult [about being poor] and may exacerbate it. <strong><o:p></o:p></strong> </p><p class=\"pullquote\">The message that you're going to \"independent\" your way to singlehood is designed to herd women back into more traditional emotional and legal setups...The message is: <i>get back.</i><br> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>As people are marrying later in life, a trend we're seeing in many parts around the globe, do you think we are evolving out of marriage, especially as women gain economic and sexual equality? <br></strong>I think we're evolving out of it as a norm and an expectation, and evolving into a world in which there are a number of romantic, sexual, and familial configurations, and that hetero marriage will be one among them. I also think we're evolving very, very slowly into an era in which marriage, and hetero partnership in general, becomes more egalitarian. As Susan B. Anthony predicted 150 years ago, part of that evolution is going through a stage in which women stop marrying men in the numbers that they used to. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Later marriage means lower divorce rates. After doing the research, how do you feel about your own \"late\" marriage at 35? <br></strong>It's so funny that my marriage is 'late' by any historical standard; in New York City, I was amongst the first of my friends to marry. The fact that I fell in love with this guy is the most shocking part of my life, more than that I'm married. I just feel immensely lucky to have been unmarried when I met my husband. I had a lot of opportunities in front of me because I come from a fairly privileged population where I went to college and had the ability to pursue a career that I loved writing about subjects I loved living in a city I loved. This is how privilege accrues and expands for people. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>In the book, you cite sociologist Bella DePaulo, who says there are more than  </strong><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/02/08/everything-you-think-you-know-about-single-people-is-wrong\"><strong>1,000 laws</strong></a><strong> that benefit married people over singles. Now that we have marriage equality in the US, do you think \"single equality\" will be next? <br></strong>I hope so. Bella DePaulo is absolutely indispensable on the variety of penalties paid by Americans who live outside of marriage. And I would love to see a move toward \"single equality,\" which I think we get closer to by pushing for a lot of social policy fixes like the ones I outline in my appendix [such as stronger equal pay protections, a higher minimum wage, government-subsidized or funded daycare programs, and paid family leave for women and men, among other policies]. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <!--[endif]--> <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Do you expect any backlash toward the book? How do you hope the book ages? <br></strong>I don't think that there's been much controversy yet, but I do expect conservatives to push back at my insistence that marriage is not the cure for poverty. And I expect some backlash from people who see this as a glorification of single life over married life, which it's not meant to be. I hope that the book ages as one of the many documents that chronicles the massive social, economic, sexual shifts women have made over their centuries of living in and pushing toward a more equal set of opportunities in America. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>In 2012, unmarried women—who are more politically engaged than their married counterparts—made up  </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/09/singe-women-voted-favour-obama\"><strong>23%</strong></a><strong> of the electorate. What role will they play in 2016? <br></strong>They could play a totally determinate roll if they vote in the numbers that are possible. There are a lot of structural impediments to single women voting whether it's voting times curtailed, the hours polls are open, places to register or having to get special IDs to bring to voting places. These are things that take time that plenty of single parents and women do not have. Finally the Democratic platform is dealing with some of the fixes that single people need. Nobody talked about the  <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/01/12/3738327\">Hyde Amendment</a> until Hillary Clinton did in this election; no one has made paid leave central to a campaign—all these things are relatively new. Unmarried women could be determinative this election, but so much depends on their ability and enthusiasm to vote. </p><p><em>'All the Single Ladies' is out now on Simon & Schuster.

The most intimate expression of gay sex was lethal,\" Gibson adds. \"But for the first time people aren't afraid.\"</p><p>There are also many sociological reasons why gay men might want fetishize bodily fluids—to be cumpigs, in other words. Since the 1970s, Dr. William Leap, currently a professor at American University, has studied the ways gay people use language to express sexual identity. Leap says the language surrounding bareback sex, including words like \"breed and seed,\" imply the transmission of power from one man to another. Leap cites a puberty ceremony of the <a href=\"http://www.orijinculture.com/community/masculinisation-dehumanization-sambia-tribe-papua-guinea/\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">Sambia people of Papua New Guinea</span></a> as an example of how semen can take on mystical qualities; part of the ritual involves boys ingesting the semen of tribal elders to absorb a life force and fully become men. The idea that gay men might be recreating such rituals in the bedroom may not be that far off. <o:p></o:p></p><p>Adult entertainment insiders echo Leap's notion. According to Leo Forte, a director and videographer for Kink.com: \"In porn, we worship this image of guys with the biggest dicks. The bigger the cock, the bigger the load, and the more masculine the man whose seed will be inside of me.\"<o:p></o:p></p><p>Leap thinks it may not be just the literal viscous semen that is desired, but the feelings of transgression surrounding the act of transmission. And, like many sexual taboos, these feelings become something to fantasize over, fetishize, exploit, or even be addicted to. <o:p></o:p></p><p>\"Real queerness means pushing boundaries of what is forbidden,\" says Leap. \"Semen transmission is a form of personal contact that normative society says is wrong for gay men to do. The idea that there is risk is what makes gay sex attractive; it's illegal, condemned, and justice may come crashing down on you at any moment.\"<o:p></o:p></p><p>\"Cum is glorified so much because it contains the essence of taboo,\" agrees Forte. \"<i>Look how it is spraying all over this guy's face. It's going near his asshole, oh no!</i>\" <o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"pullquote\">\"Semen transmission is a form of personal contact that normative society says is wrong for gay men to do.\" — Dr. William Leap<br></p><p>There's evidence that these taboos around semen have loosened since PrEP was approved by the FDA in 2012. One <a href=\"http://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/large-study-of-prep-use-in-clinical-practice-shows-no-new-hiv-infections/\">32-month study of PrEP users</a> released by Kaiser Permanente in 2015 found no new HIV infections among participants—but 41 percent of them reported using condoms less often.<o:p></o:p></p><p>It's probably simplistic to attribute the rise in barebacking simply to PrEP. <a href=\"http://www.thebody.com/content/77182/how-to-have-sex-in-a-new-epidemic-of-stis.html?ap=1100\">This week Howard Grossman</a>, a gay doctor in New York who sees a lot of LGBT people, wrote that he has observed spiking STI rates in patients who are on PrEP and not on PrEP, both HIV+ and HIV-. This dovetails with CDC reports that syphilis, a disease that disproportionately affects men who have sex with men, is <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm\">on the rise</a>. <o:p></o:p></p><p>Grossman suggested that PrEP wasn't the culprit in all this. \"The real problem, in my view, is that adequate screening and treatment for STIs is often not available, and education about STIs in the United States sucks (to put it mildly),\" he wrote. \"For the last 30 years, the only message about sexual health that many young people received was either to practice abstinence only or, in more liberal venues, to wear a condom every time to prevent HIV.\"<o:p></o:p></p><p>Despite these problems, there are reasons to be hopeful—today many gay men have more open attitudes toward sex and semen than they once did, but more importantly they are not forced into the shadows as previous LGBT generations were. Queer rights and acceptance have given us freedoms that were unimaginable in the immediate post-Stonewall era—we're in a place where the first known man to get HIV while properly using PrEP <a href=\"https://www.poz.com/article/meet-man-got-hiv-daily-prep\">can tell <i>Poz</i></a>, \"I believe in personal accountability and responsibility for your own health. I'm open and upfront with all sexual partners, from my status to my dislike of condoms.\"<o:p></o:p></p><p><o:p></o:p></p><p>Maybe the recent rise of unprotected sex is an aberration; maybe the pendulum will swing back the other way and condomless sex will once again be regarded as practically a crime. But for now, I can't get cum out of my head, or off my face. <o:p></o:p></p><p><em>Follow Matthew on </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsjustmematt\">Twitter</a>.</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsjustmematt\"></a></p><!--EndFragment-->",

For more information, visit the documentary's <a href=\"http://www.goredthemovie.com/\">website here.</a></i></p><p>Antonio Barrera is not a great bullfighter. As the Spanish bullfighting critic J.A. del Moral puts it in Ido Mizrahy's documentary  <i>Gored, </i> he has no \"aesthetic grace.\" In other words, he isn't one of the \"artist\" matadors with an \"aesthetic purity...from another galaxy.\" Barrera never reaches the point where the spectacle stops being \"a mere fight\" and becomes \"a tragic ballet of extraordinary beauty.\" </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\">But he makes up for these failings with unflinching bravery. Barrera is proud to \"offer his life 100 percent\" every time he enters a bull ring; and, with 23  <i>cornadas</i>, he is the most gored bullfighter in modern history.  <i>Gored</i> gives us glimpses of his near-death experiences: On his knees in front of a thousand-pound bull in the pouring rain; hopping around the ring with a makeshift tourniquet around his bloody upper thigh; staggering, bare-chested, bare-buttocked, bleeding from various wounds, his \"suit of lights\" split open at the seams by the bull's horns; on a stretcher being rushed to the ringside infirmary unable to breathe. His wife is desperate for him to give it up, but when they first fell in love she promised to never ask him to retire.</p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><i>Gored</i> tells the story of the run-up to Antonio Barrera's planned retirement from bullfighting and his final fight against a beast, aptly-named Bienvenido. After making the festival rounds last spring (including a slot at Tribeca Film Festival),  <em>Gored </em>is now available for the public to watch online. We talked to director Ido Mizrahy about his bloody doc, and why he doesn't expect bullfighting to die out anytime soon. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/a-look-at-the-life-of-the-most-gored-bullfighter-in-modern-history-body-image-1457039371-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"563\" data-model-id=\"152835\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"a-look-at-the-life-of-the-most-gored-bullfighter-in-modern-history-body-image-1457039371.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></p><p><strong>VICE: H</strong><strong>ow did you originally find out about Antonio Barrera? Were you a fan? <br></strong><strong>Ido Mizrahy:</strong> No, not at all. My writing partner [the journalist Geoff Gray] had become interested in this ancient spectacle of bullfighting. He met Antonio Barrera in Spain, and  <a href=\"http://www.si.com/vault/2011/05/09/106066410/the-dangerous-obsession-of-antonio-barrera\">did a profile on him</a>. They stayed in touch, and when Antonio mentioned he might retire, we thought it might make an interesting short film. Once we started filming, however, we realized it was a much fuller story... it wanted to be a feature-length documentary. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>By all accounts, Barrera is not a particularly gifted bullfighter. What was it that drew you to him as a subject? <br></strong>What was interesting to me is that he <i> wasn't</i> one of the gods of bullfighting. He didn't have the artistry, the  <i>duende </i>that's expected from the great <i>figuras, </i>but rather he was just a human being trying to do this. His destiny was set in motion for him: his father was a failed bullfighter and put Antonio in front of the bulls when he was 7, but he just didn't have the goods. So he created his own brand of bullfighting that was really more about coming back from the dead, and became famous for it. And he had to keep that style because that was what drew people to see him. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>Barrera is Spanish, but his career seems to have played out mainly in Mexico. Why is that? <br></strong>Antonio felt much more welcome in Mexico for a variety of reasons, but mostly because Mexicans really appreciated what he put out there. The Spanish  <i>affición</i> get pretty snarky about bravery. They tend to think, <i>Of course you're supposed to be brave, that's a given. The big deal is to be an artist while you're doing it. </i> Whereas in Mexico they seemed to be saying,  <i>We know you're not a great artist, but give us everything you've got anyway. We want to see you put your guts out there, and we'll respect you for it.  </i>Antonio could offer that. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>Bullfighting is obviously a controversial subject. Were you confident audiences and critics would see beyond any debates about its morality? <br></strong>We knew we were walking into fertile ground, but, in a way, that's what you want as a filmmaker. The choice of having Antonio Barrera as the protagonist, rather than bullfighting in general, was a good way of not hiding from the subject, but rather putting it at eye-level. Especially as Antonio isn't a poster-boy for bullfighting and doesn't exhibit that artistry, so you never get swallowed up by the romance. We're not trying to justify bullfighting, which is why I think lots of people who are anti-bullfighting have loved the movie, because it doesn't feel like a bullfighting film. It's about obsession, life and death, broken dreams, family. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>But, as Antonio Barrera emphatically says at the end of the doc, \"I am a bullfighter.\" He's not just \"any man\" dealing with these issues. Would someone like Antonio, or many of the themes arising from his story, even exist outside of bullfighting? <br></strong>No, and that's exactly why bullfighting still exists. There's still a really visceral need to be around death in a controlled environment. Today news channels feed us death all the time, but that's very different. That's driven by politics, conquest—lots of other things. For us to be able to go into a controlled environment and see man try to submit nature in that way, and share in that incredibly difficult task, I think that's what keeps bullfighting relevant. Which is why there's so much pushback against it. If it was just fading away, people would let it be. But I think it still has so many fans and still exists because it satisfies something really primal. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/a-look-at-the-life-of-the-most-gored-bullfighter-in-modern-history-body-image-1457039397-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"563\" data-model-id=\"152836\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"a-look-at-the-life-of-the-most-gored-bullfighter-in-modern-history-body-image-1457039397.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>Has making the film changed your view of bullfighting? <br></strong>I find myself much more interested. A film takes a long time to make, so you have to be submerged in the subject. You have to learn to understand your subject without judging it. It didn't turn me into a fan, but I am not a protestor. To my sensibility, I don't necessarily enjoy it, but there's something about it that I totally understand now, and which tells me why it's still around. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>How did Barrera respond to the film? <br></strong>I have no idea. So here's the other reality about trying to make a movie about a matador: they are really tricky to pin down. He's like a bull; if you're not within his peripheral vision, you cannot reach Antonio Barrera. As close and as intimate a time as we had with him, when he's not in front of us physically, we can't reach him. As soon as we finished, I wanted his take on it before I even locked picture, but he never responded. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><strong>Was it difficult filming such crucial moments in his life? <br></strong>We met him when he was making the most painful decision he's ever made. Getting gored over and over again wasn't painful for him anymore, but to make the decision to walk away from the bulls? That was really painful. To film his family in the days leading up to his final bullfight... they couldn't care less about us. We're filming people dealing with life-shattering decisions. And everyone had a stake in it: his wife, his daughter, his father-in-law. Everyone was so invested, and the camera was so low on their priority list, that we filmed the real stuff. It's a very privileged point of view, real access to something, which is incredibly rare in documentaries. </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"Body\"><i>'Gored' is out now on iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon.

From the night guards who watch over people getting pissed beyond their limits to the pasty ex-pats, sex workers, and wasters who fill the city's bars, he pointed his lens at scenes that would look familiar to anyone who's been blackout drunk, but may not be what first comes to mind when someone says \"Uganda.\"</p><p>Some of Michele's favorite photos from the project are collected in book '<em><a href=\"https://www.editionpatrickfrey.com/en/books/fuck-it-michele-sibiloni\" target=\"_blank\">Fuck It</a></em>,' out this month. We asked him about spending most of his waking hours in the part of Kampala once apparently described as \"Tijuana on acid,\" and what it taught him about sex, class, and stereotypes. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457094146-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"796\" data-model-id=\"153054\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457094146.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><br><strong>VICE: Hi, Michele. You seem to thrive out on the streets, as your <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/profile/michele-sibiloni-.html\" target=\"_blank\">hard news reporting</a> on drug use and armed rebel groups shows. But how did you transition from covering heavier stuff to parties?<br></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>ichele Sibiloni</strong>: After a couple of years in Uganda, covering news in the Great Lakes region—including DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi—I had quite good pictures and I was happy that I was learning, but something was missing. I wasn't always satisfied with my pictures and I wanted to add something personal, and more related to my life, into my work. I realised that one of the reasons I loved living here was to have the chance to be out at night. </p><p><strong>How did the nightlife series take shape, then?<br></strong>It all stemmed from one photo I took of a night guard, which is also the first picture inside the book. From that picture, I decided to do a series of portraits of these night guards. I was taking my camera out with me here and there, but not in as obsessed a way as this. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030717-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-model-id=\"152773\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030717.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>How were people reacting to your camera when you were out? Club photography's pretty normalized, but not everyone loves having a flash gun in their face at 1AM.<br></strong>It depends. Some people didn't mind much, some asked for an explanation. Others also got pissed off—it was all different. But the more I did it, the more I got comfortable with it, and started to believe that it was my right to take pictures. I had to hide my camera a lot, because they check you at the door and once you're in and have taken a photo or two, people may come over and ask you to leave. Sometimes I'd have to wait, find that moment for a good picture, then take it and see whether I was going to get asked to leave. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457094497-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"796\" data-model-id=\"153057\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457094497.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><!--recommended--><p>After doing my <a href=\"http://www.michelesibiloni.com/Ascaris\" target=\"_blank\">night guard series</a> I started to go out a lot, to bars, to parties, and out onto the streets to capture every aspect related to Ugandan society at night. The more I did it, the more interested I became, because I started to get new kinds of photos that I hadn't taken before. I didn't have a book in mind or anything. I just wanted to go out and document that part of Ugandan society, and one aspect of my life here. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030761-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"801\" data-model-id=\"152776\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030761.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>What kind of places were you going to? Was that affecting your access?<br></strong>It was every different place, from house parties with ex-pats to bars and clubs in Kabalagala—sort of Kampala's red light district. There are bars and clubs there, people cooking in the streets, small hotels where people would take their girls to have sex. And in a few of those bars you'd find the middle-aged white men looking for younger girls. There were smaller, more local bars too, in areas that would be considered more like slums or ghettos. By now it feels as though I've been to every pat of Kampala—maybe not every bar, but every part of town. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030735-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"792\" data-model-id=\"152775\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030735.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>What was that like? What sort of people did you encounter?<br></strong>I found that the special thing about Kampala is that in certain places you can find every sort of person inside a bar, from rich to poor. It's unique; there isn't that much class-based discrimination. I mean, of course, if a beer costs £1 in one bar or 75p in another, then people may tend to go to the cheaper place. But there aren't strictly places \"just for rich people.\" Also, the same sex workers tend to go to the fancy places as to the poorer places. When I was moving around, I found that at night there was a sort of democracy where social classes didn't matter that much anymore, and people were mixing and using each other in different ways. It wasn't like what I've seen in Kenya, where there were places for rich people and others for poorer people. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457086242-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"797\" data-model-id=\"152968\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457086242.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>You met a lot of people along the way, who have turned into characters in your photos. Tell me more about Sandra, whose tattoo  of a dick (below) gave your book its name.<br></strong>She's a person I know, who I've filmed and interviewed. She wrote a couple of stories for the book for me, about being a prostitute and working in Kabalagala, about HIV/AIDS. The stories were very interesting, but I didn't feel comfortable putting them in the book because I wanted the viewer to have his or her own journey through the photos. I didn't want to focus their attention on the matters of HIV or prostitutes or whatever. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030792-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152777\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030792.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>The book isn't just about that, but is something that I don't want to be attached to any stereotype. When I first arrived in Africa, I had so many stereotypes in my mind that had been lodged there by news reports or stories I read in the media, and I wanted to make <em>Fuck It</em> feel completely different. That's why I wanted to mix as many people in the book as I could: my friends, ex-pats, sex workers, every sort of person I was encountering. </p><p><strong>Do you think the average European consumer, who hasn't left the continent before, will understand that message, with captions or information to guide them?<br></strong>I don't know... I hope so. I believe it's quite a unique story. When they saw the book, some of my friends here in Uganda even asked me when I started to hang out with \"these sorts\" of people. It was something new for them, too. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030807-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"783\" data-model-id=\"152778\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030807.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>Did it feel weird photographing people who were wasted? Do you have pictures that you wouldn't use?<br></strong>Of course. For a couple of the pictures I had to ask people if they'd be alright with being published looking a bit worse for wear. Maybe it wouldn't be one of their best moments ... but they understood the project, and agreed. And I did the edit after choosing the book title, so some pictures that I took wouldn't fit that certain attitude. A lot of people living here are maybe running away from something, and going out at night to forget about their responsibilities—they say \"fuck it,\" and live a little recklessly. That's why the edit's turned out like this. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030831-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"776\" data-model-id=\"152779\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030831.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>What were the best parties?<br></strong>It wasn't about the parties for me. Or even when it was a good party, I was always just passing through on my way somewhere else. I was on a different type of journey—but of course I was partying, too. I was more comfortable being out in certain places, because when I was younger—18, 20—I raved a lot. But I wasn't in it for the parties, I just wanted the encounters and the pictures that came from them the parties. One of my goals when I started this project was to see my experience—I wanted to do something personal, like personal documentary. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030865-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"797\" data-model-id=\"152781\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"fuck-it-photography-uganda-nightlife-michele-sibiloni-body-image-1457030865.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>Of course, it'll reflect on aspects of society, but sometimes the more you try to tell, the less you convey. So I think this tells you about one part of Ugandan society at night in Kampala. It's a politically repressed and traditionally conservative society—with anti-gay laws, a recent anti-pornography bill and laws pushed by American evangelical churches feeding people lies about sexuality—but behind closed doors, people don't really care. They party here the way they would in London, Paris, or New York. </p><p><strong>Thanks, Michele.</strong> </p><p>Fuck It <em>is out on Thursday March 10, via <a href=\"https://www.editionpatrickfrey.com/en/books/fuck-it-michele-sibiloni\" target=\"_blank\">Edition Patrick Frey</a>.</em><br> </p><p><em>Follow Tshepo on </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tnm___\"><em>Twitter</em></a></p><p><br></p>",

I point at the radio and the taxi driver flips it off with a pleasant \"Excuse me.\" He's used to foreigners and rich Thais looking down on his music, but I want him to turn it up, explaining I'm a Molam fan and headed to a nearby club to hear the same music live. He eagerly shows me a video on his phone of his granddaughter practicing Molam in her bedroom in Isaan. By the end of the taxi ride, we're both cruising to the tunes with grins on our faces.</p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Molam is country music that's been played in the Thai and Laotian hinterlands since the 17th century. Its Thai home is in Isaan, a region in the Northeast of the country where many working class people live. At its most simple, a traditional Molam act features only a singer and a khaen player, which is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLAMtWhE_v4\">bamboo mouth organ</a> played vertically in bass tones designed to support a singer's voice. Beyond that, the most common additions to a Molam band are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glTNjofFeGA\">phin</a>, a small lute with strings, drums, and bass.<br><br>Molam underwent a major shift in the 70s, thanks to the influence of the American GIs stationed at five army bases around Isaan. They brought psychedelic, rock, soul, and funk music with them from America via guitars, records, and radio stations broadcast from the bases. The Molam players absorbed these sounds and were intrigued by them. Entire riffs from bands like Black Sabbath and  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSufID_9xiI\">The Rolling Stones </a> were incorporated into Molam songs from this era.</p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Until recently, Molam music was marginalized and dismissed as \"taxi driver music,\" or entertainment for the lower classes. But with its psychedelic riffs and country jams, the genre is experiencing a new life worldwide, mostly thanks to Nattapon \"Nat\" Siangsukon, better known as DJ Maft Sai, who runs three record labels, a record store, and a club that is bringing modern Molam to international audiences. And the West is embracing it.<br><br> </p><div class=\"resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dMVdMU25S_w\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"640px\" data-original-height=\"360px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">A vintage track by  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHJYKoIhMx4\">Dao Bandon</a> was featured on the soundtrack of <i>The Hangover Part II </i>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMVdMU25S_w\">Paradise Bangkok Molam International Band</a> opened for Damon Albarn in Berlin in 2014.

Image courtesy of Jim Thompson House </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Since Molam was looked-down on in Bangkok for so long, most of the famed musicians hadn't played in the city since the 70s. To procure live music for his popular parties, Maft Sai had to trek out to Isaan and knock on doors to find the old stars. Many of them had retired to villages and were raising chickens and buffalo. \"It would take six months to organize a party because I had to track down all the vocalists and musicians and convince them to play. I would spend an entire year throwing two parties.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Finding the musicians wasn't the only stumbling block to getting this music back on the map. ZudRangMa Records has been putting out reissues and vintage compilations of Thai music since 2010. \"Back then, we might sell just seven copies a year in Thailand. I realized that we had to promote it abroad.\" That was when taste-making record shops All That Jazz, Rough Trade, and Soul Jazz in the UK started stocking and promoting this music. <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">The compilations featured covers with traditional Thai cloth and were marketed as \"Thai funk.\" Influential Thais that lived and traveled abroad saw them and bought them. They'd come back to Thailand and show them to their friends, who would start coming to events. According to Maft Sai, the idea of Molam as respectable was a hard pill for urban Thais to swallow until they saw that it was sought after by foreigners.<br><br></p><div class=\"resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lHJYKoIhMx4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"640px\" data-original-height=\"360px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class=\"normal\">The 20th century strain of Molam music features trippy riffs, hypnotic patterns, and drawn-out, inventive solos. Maft Sai's favorite era of Molam is slightly older than he is, though. \"The modern Molam sound actually comes from the 70s. It's like reggae. They use the same lines but each band uses slightly different instrumentation and style. Some use the traditional phin and khaen, some use a brass band; some add guitar or keyboard.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">According to Piyanart \"Pump\" Jotikasthira, the bass player of Paradise Bangkok Molam International Band, \"What makes Molam psychedelic is the khaen. It has that surreal sound that people recognize. It's the way it lengthens the notes.\" Khaen can recreate the drama of a pipe organ but the sound can be better controlled and manipulated as the player breathes into it.</p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">John Clewley, a music writer and musician from the UK who's been living in Thailand since the 80s, agreed, saying, \"For foreigners, the khaen is a big draw. People have never heard or seen this before. Khaen players can do these big cathedral chords, like power chords, and people are amazed.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Clewley first encountered Molam at a village party in Isaan, where he lived with his Thai wife. \"I loved it. I danced with the [locals] all night. It reminded me of Irish folk music, but instead of a fiddle, you've got a khaen. They start playing at 9PM and finish at 5 in the morning. We once had a party at our house and one of the bands played. The whole village, all 300 people, came. In the morning, there were people asleep in the bushes. It looked like the aftermath of a war. When they woke up, they just walked off and got noodles.\"  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">Maft Sai agrees, \"If you want to see the real-deal Molam, you have to go to a private party in the country where they kill a cow, the whole village shares it and they play music until 10 in the morning.\" <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\">If that sounds too intense, try a crash course in Molam by stepping into a Bangkok taxi and asking the driver to play you his favorite songs. He'll probably be thrilled. <o:p></o:p> </p><p><em>For more on ZudRangMa records, visit its <a href=\"http://www.zudrangmarecords.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=8&Itemid=105\">website here.</a></em> </p><p><em>Follow Laurel on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laureltuohy\">Twitter</a>.</em> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"normal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><!--EndFragment-->",

And now we've come almost full-circle, to food like the freakshake: an oozing, aggressively layered ice cream milkshake, first \"invented\" at a bakery in Australia last year. It's the latest food trend to send giddy bloggers and lifestyle sites (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scroobiuspipyo/status/694935199847731201\" target=\"_blank\">Scroobius Pip</a>) frothing at the mouth. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010138-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152620\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010138.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>\"I wanted to do some really great shakes, and so ridiculous and over the top that people just had to take a photo of it before they ate it,\" original freakshake creator Gina Petridis <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/07/14/patissez-milkshakes-canberra/#iE.3ci7sqkqI\" target=\"_blank\">told Mashable</a>, without a hint of sarcasm. Predictably, it wasn't long until the shakes came to Britain. Now you can get them in <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/freak-shakes-dessert-craze-sweet-10893467\" target=\"_blank\">Bangor</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gbcupcakery/\" target=\"_blank\">Newcastle</a>—where they've been christened \"geet big shakes\"—and from a bakery and cafe in east London. </p><p>When I first walked into <a href=\"https://www.mollybakes.co.uk/our-cafe/\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Bakes</a>, the Dalston freakshake café run by husband and wife Olly and Maria,  it was with a feeling of trepidation. I'd seen photos and the milkshakes were massive. Like, huge in a way that looks uncomfortable. Large on a scale that slots into the trend of food items that barely hold together, from glisteningly greasy Dirty Burgers to the <em>Great British Bake Off</em> \"showstoppers.\" I was terrified. Olly, who looks after the running of the café while his wife manages their bakery down the road, told me that often people walk into the café, take one look at the menu and walk straight out. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010157-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152621\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010157.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010181-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"763\" data-model-id=\"152622\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010181.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>Others stay, obviously, and the freakshake's debut at the café in January saw a queue outside that apparently ran halfway down the street. \"We had to turn about 200 people away,\" Olly tells me excitedly. This, a queue of people standing outside a food vendor for a bite of the latest trend, is a fairly regular occurrence in London and other cities driven by money spent on things that people don't really need. </p><!--recommended--><p>Usually it's for overly indulgent meat-based food—mega-burgers and the like.

I chose the caramel option because it looked the sickliest. The staff told me that everyone has their own way of eating the freakshake, but I decided to drink the liquid first then work my way through the rest. My favorite part was weirdly the decorative rim of the milkshake's glass. It was covered in little crunchy chocolate balls mixed with chocolate sauce and biscuit crumbs, and a small slice of honeycomb. As far as a dessert goes that could make you vomit, it tasted delicious. Still, I couldn't finish it. </p><blockquote><strong>On Munchies: </strong><a href=\"https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-fast-food-cricket-milkshake-might-save-the-world\"><strong>This Fast-Food Cricket Milkshake Might Save the World</strong></a> </blockquote><p>Nutritionist Carolina Brooks asked me if I was \"OK after that milkshake\" when I told her I'd sampled one—which I am, I think. Like most people in the business of monitoring how people eat, she thinks that a diet free from refined, non-natural sugar is the best way forward. That might explain her freakshake-related concern. </p><p>\"We are programmed to enjoy sugar—our brain runs on glucose,\" she said. \"So we do need the sweet taste in our lives. But once you cut out the crap,\" read: refined sugar, \"you really notice your taste buds change, and you start wanting to eat better things anyway.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010211-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152623\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457010211.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>Unfortunately for sugar-free crusaders, the freakshake isn't just another gross-looking food trend that may quickly disappear; it's much more complex than that. Dr Morgaine Gaye, a food futurologist at the food trend forecasters <a href=\"http://www.bellwetherft.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Bellwether</a>, told me about the significance of the freakshake to the future of food. </p><p>\"Right now, we're seeing a lot of people getting involved in the anti-sugar campaign—and they should, as it is really important—but there is always a counter-trend,\" she said. \"And this is it. Everyone is trying to be better and more successful and more beautiful. The reality is that no one can really maintain that.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457108272-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"153271\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457108272.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457108212-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"153270\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"freakshakes-hype-food-london-molly-bakes-body-image-1457108212.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>\"The freakshake is a rebellion against trying to cram in perfection, and says 'fuck it' to the idea that people can maintain hyper-healthy lifestyles.

If you buy into them and their marketing technique, they could do wonders for attracting the kinds of Instagram followers still using Pinterest. If not, you're faced with a complicated sundae that costs more than a pint—but maybe imagining the M&S lady huskily saying that would make it worthwhile. </p><p><em>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ameliadimz\">Amelia</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jake_photo\">Jake</a> on Twitter.</em></p><p><em><br></em></p>",

The island has been largely visited and inhabited by Scandinavians since the 1960s, but had its heydays in the 1990s when \"charter vacations,\" or low-budget resort vacations, became affordable for the working and middle classes. </p><p>I recall many blithe childhood memories from our time in Gran Canaria: Long days at the beach, poking jellyfish with a stick, hours spent in front of an aquarium at our go-to restaurant, all in service of escaping the darkest months of Norwegian winter back home. </p><p>Last month, I returned to Gran Canaria with my parents for the first time in almost 15 years, curious to see see what had become of the place. As we drove along the coast, I lost count of the \"for sale\" signs standing guard outside the empty lots and hotels. The whole town seemed to be crumbling to dust. The architecture—all cheap materials with color schemes of washed-out pink, bright yellow, and baby blue reminiscent of the 60s—seemed all the more dated with the absence of tourists, who, I was told, favor AirBnB over resorts these days. </p><p>Maybe unsurprisingly, Gran Canaria left me feeling weird. After leaving the once-familiar place, I flew straight to Switzerland for a photo shoot. While there, I decided to drive to the village of Andermatt, the first Swiss skiing resort I found on Google Maps. As I drove through the small village, I felt surprised by how the tone and mood eerily paralleled my previous destination, despite it being my first time in the Alps (and the drastic change in climate): Empty luxury apartments and hotels, guest houses, local diners... even the slopes were empty, despite the ideal skiing conditions. </p><p>Both Andermatt and Gran Canaria struck me as crumbling vestiges that signify a dying generation of tourism—the type of vacation destinations that present-day visitors still book through a travel agent. While shooting at both, I aimed to document the objects and moments that inspired the same type of spooky hollowness I felt at the two distinct locales.</p><p><em>For more of Tonje's work, visit her <a href=\"http://tonjethilesen.com/\">website</a> and </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tonjethilesen/?hl=en\"><em>Instagram.</em></a></p>",

His stories often involve characters in homoerotic settings or participating in BDSM scenes where the macho main character is transformed into a sub and finds his true calling in chains or fetish-gear. Tagame is not afraid of touchy subjects and taboos, writing stories featuring Nazi prisoners, bestiality, incest, scat, permanent body modification and Japanese WWII soldiers captured and tortured by Chinese liberation groups. Yet, his manga goes beyond illustrated fan fiction or quick masturbation fodder, and often feels more like it's depicting a quest for an existence beyond pain. </p><p>Tagame realized his own BDSM fetish when he was a child. After watching the scene in<em>Planet of the Apes </em>where Charles Heston is dragged by a leather collar, he felt an indescribable sensation inside him, leading the artist into further research about S&M. While studying art in college in the 80s, he started publishing queer illustrations under a pen name, and continued writing erotic stories throughout his twenties while supporting himself with a job as a graphic designer. Over the next 30 years, he published more than 20 books in four languages in addition to selling hundreds of fine art prints and illustrations. Today, at 51-years-old, the illustrator continues to expand his creative horizons, and recently serialized a queer story called <em>My Brother's Husband</em> in <em>Monthly Action Comics</em>, an otherwise-hetero magazine. The manga was then collated into a book with the same title, which is now in its fifth printing due to overwhelming popularity. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of Tagame's most notorious stories is <em>Shirogane no Hana </em><em>(Silver Flower)</em>, a historical drama set at the start of the 20th-century about a spoiled son who's turned into a sex worker before exploring his own passion for S&M. The epic, three-volume story totals 900 pages—the  <i>1Q84 </i>of niche, queer manga. His latest,  <i>My Brother's Husband </i>shares the same focus on identity, despite the text being young adult-friendly and safe for work, unlike his most famous work. Both stories affirm that we should be proud of who or what we love no matter how different or extreme it may appear to be.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This past November,  <i>My Brother's Husband</i> <a href=\"http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1455753\">received the Excellence Award</a> from the  Japan Media Arts Festival by the Agency of Cultural Affairs, one of the highest recognitions in Japanese pop culture. VICE spoke with Tagame about his life and what it means to be a queer artist in Japan.  <!--recommended-->  <i><o:p></o:p></i> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127089-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"153331\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127089.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>VICE: When did you first begin to understand your own sexuality? <br></strong><strong>Gengoro Tagame:</strong> Naked and bound men have excited me since I was in elementary school. I remember getting excited watching Italian Hercules movies and Hollywood science fiction films like the original  <i>Planet of the Apes</i>. I liked the scene where Charlton Heston was ordered to take his stinky human clothes off in front of the ape's assembly, then dragged by a leather collar. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Later, I found a copy of <i>SABU</i> [a queer Japanese magazine] at a bookstore when I was in middle school. I got excited reading any S&M stories, including heterosexual ones, as long as the men in the stories got abused. In contrast, I was not turned on by love stories where two men make love to each other. I was confused about my sexuality, both about being gay, as well as being into S&M.  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">By high school, I started to question why I couldn't be honest with myself. I realized I didn't have to suffer while hiding my true emotions if I was up front about my sexuality from the very beginning. This led to me coming out during my freshman year of college.  <o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127127-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"1404\" data-model-id=\"153332\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127127.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How did you start submitting work to gay publications? <br></strong>I started to submit my work during my college years under different identities. All of the work was based on BDSM; dark stories, incest, sons murdering fathers, a high school student turning a teacher into his slave, abduction, confinement, and so on...  Some were just stories and others were illustrations and manga. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this same period, I had my first trip to Europe and discovered the American hardcore S&M gay magazine  <i>DRUMMER</i>.  It featured a drawing by Bill Ward, who made a strong impression on my art.  Bill had an exceptional quality beyond what I found in Japanese gay art at that time.  American magazines also featured masculine gay men and guys with beards—which was unheard of in Japan.

What is it about erotic and pornographic work that keeps you interested?  <br></strong>Since college, I've been especially interested in religious art. I am not a Christian, but I'm moved by Christian art as well as Tibetan Buddhist art. Religious painters do not draw to express themselves. Rather, the act of creation is the highest form of respect, creating a symbol of their belief. That emotional strength [created by religious art] comes from purity.  I believe pornographic art has the same characteristic. Porn is a search for the perfect erotic expression. It's not necessarily self-assertiveness, nor a status symbol, but uncontrollable desires. Pursuing such pure pleasure is less complicated. In such pursuits, pornographic art is pure, fine art. My goal is beyond manga or porn, but to aim for the level of  <i>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</i>.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127216-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"1421\" data-model-id=\"153335\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"inside-the-taboo-filled-mind-of-japans-best-bdsm-manga-artist-body-image-1457127216.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Cover for his new manga series 'My Brother's Husband' by <a href=\"http://www.futabasha.co.jp/booksdb/book/bookview/978-4-575-84741-3.html\">Futaba Publishing Ltd.</a></p><p><strong>Your newest series \"My Brother's Husband\" is a big hit in Japan.  Tell us what made you decide to publish your gay story in a non-gay manga. <br></strong>A publisher approached me and was very supportive, so the project took off quickly.  At the time, gay marriage was becoming a worldwide trend, but in Japan gays are still invisible to society and the gay rights movement does not resonate with many. Manga is a part of pop culture and may be an interesting tool to spread gay rights issues to larger audiences, so I came up with a plot where the main character is heterosexual but his twin brother is gay and married to a man. This set up was easier for straight people to accept. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Do you expect Japan to change its attitude towards homosexuality in the future? <br></strong>Same sex marriage is moving fast and I cannot predict what will happen next in Japan.

I wrote  <i>My Brother's Husband</i> with my known identity, hoping that sends the right message. I'm a gay artist and I don't have to hide my identity to make a manga for straight people.

Marco Rubio, Trump said, \"hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?\" While the crowd laughed, Trump went on: \"He referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.\" </p><p>\"OK,\" moderator Bret Baier said, clearly not knowing what to do with that. \"Moving on.\" </p><p>But the mogul wasn't ready to move on.

He thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else, but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self-image, he coils like a caged ferret.

That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him—generally a tear sheet from a magazine.

(Patrick Farrell/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images) </p><p>Like many topics that consume the public political debate, the size of Trump's hands and the slimness of his fingers is a controversy with two sides, but only one side can be correct: Are his hands the big, beautiful appendages he claims they are, or are they pathetic little stubs? </p><p>To get an unbiased opinion, I reached out to Dani Korwin, an agent at <a href=\"http://www.partsmodels.com/\">Parts Models</a>. Parts does exactly what its name suggests: cast models for jobs that require magnificent parts. The agency has been placing hand, leg, feet, and body models in advertisements and catalogs work since 1986. </p><p>Obviously Korwin couldn't examine Trump's hands in person, but I sent her a collection of photos of them and asked her opinion. </p><p>She was not kind. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/donald-trump-has-small-hands-body-image-1457117044-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"669\" data-model-id=\"153318\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"donald-trump-has-small-hands-body-image-1457117044.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Is this really the hand of a president?

They are somewhat smaller than what you would expect, certainly from someone of his stature.\" </p><p>\"He's not a short man, and you would expect him to have longer, more masculine fingers,\" she added.<br> </p><p>This, of course, echoes what Rubio has been saying to crowds on the campaign trail. \"He's like six-two.

When Korwin casts hand models, she's mostly looking for an even skin tone, she said. A nice shape, good nails, and nice cuticles are also something she considers. </p><p>Upon examining one close-up shot, she said, \"You can actually see the redness and sun spots.

A good-looking hand.

Labrie has since been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/10/29/owen-labrie-sentenced-to-year-in-jail-in-prep-school-sexual-assault-case/\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced</a> to a year in county jail and made to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/owen-labrie-prep-school-grad-registers-as-sex-offender-in-vermont/\" target=\"_blank\">register</a> as a sex offender. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">But there he was Monday afternoon, free—albeit under a strict curfew as he appeals his conviction. I recognized him instantly, as I was one of dozens of journalists who flocked to the cramped New Hampshire courthouse to cover the trial for VICE.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Media interest in the scandal at a prestigious prep school has been criticized by some, most notably Labrie's then attorney, J. W. Carney. The lawyer nonetheless saw fit to provide reporters with lengthy daily press conferences, and took to having his client shake hands with him in front of the camera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What sparked my own interest in the case was that a familiar phenomenon—the objectification of young women—was, at St. Paul's, said to be ritualized. The \"Senior Salute\" was basically a game where graduating seniors asked underclass students to meet for a romantic encounter, anything from a walk to sex. They would then tally their conquests, with victors in the conquest passing around a ceremonial mask, <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/19227887-95/labrie-sentenced-to-one-year-in-jail-as-st-pauls-rape-case-draws-to\">according</a> to prosecutors. But elaborate rich kid sex games aside, it was also a case that highlighted the basic difficulties of proving or disproving acquaintance rape, and came at a time when sexual assault on school campuses was receiving increased attention. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This was one of the rare cases that actually went to a public trial. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Adding to the drama on Monday, seconds after I stepped onto the train, a man got his arm stuck in the door. The whole train car screamed while a woman pulled him loose. As the poor guy quietly walked on board, rubbing his arm, another man pulled out a Rubix cube and began to curse the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) at the top of his lungs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's when I walked over to Labrie. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">I introduced myself as a reporter who covered his trial, and I sat down. To my surprise, Labrie greeted me warmly. He said he liked VICE's coverage, but since I had <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/read/who-will-the-jury-believe-in-the-new-england-elite-prep-school-rape-trial-827\">compared him to a contemporary</a> of the protagonist in <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em>, I am skeptical he actually read it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He was visiting his girlfriend, a Harvard student, and had taken her out to brunch, Labrie told me. They met at the end of his senior year, around the same time as the incident for which he was later convicted. She quietly supported him in the courtroom, he maintained. After many months at his home in Vermont, Labrie said he was just beginning to reenter society. It was a process that was at times rewarding, with strangers approaching him to offer their support. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Strangers have also come up to him and literally thrown blows, he told me, miming a punch to the face.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He talked about emotional \"ups and downs\" and having his life \"torn apart\" in the media. It was strange, perhaps, for him to be commiserating with me—arguably one of those responsible for tearing him apart. We only had five stops to go, but I was curious to learn what he made of all the attention. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labrie's case continued to grab me after the trial itself, mostly because of the lingering media coverage. A professor at Harvard Law, writing for the <em>New Yorker</em>, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/st-pauls-school-and-a-new-definition-of-rape\">suggested</a> the case was about Americans criminalizing sex we don't like. A <em>Newsweek</em> <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/photos-owen-labries-life-vermont-after-his-rape-conviction-406648\">feature</a> and photoshoot focused, among other things, on the chapel he's been building since his conviction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">His attorneys made frequent note to that chapel in sentencing, too. As if a man's piety is evidence of his innocence. Hasn't anyone else watched <em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/spotlight-celebrates-the-power-of-journalism-to-fight-corruption-1110\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight</a></em>?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labrie was miffed about a new <em>Vanity Fair</em> feature, \"<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/st-pauls-owen-labrie-rape-trial\">St. Paul's Before and After the Owen Labrie Rape Trial</a>,\" that came out this week. I hadn't read it yet, but he warned it was a \"hit piece.\" (Jezebel, for its part, <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/labries-life-is-also-in-shambles-vanity-fair-also-does-1762224061\">argued</a> the story didn't hit hard enough and claimed the magazine \"doesn't know how to cover sexual assault.\") </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Varied public opinion is inevitable in instances of acquaintance rape, where the victim makes no claims of physically resisting the encounter. These cases involving consent inevitably rest on who the jury believes most—the alleged victim or the defendant. The jury essentially determined that Labrie was lying to the court when he claimed they didn't have sex, but the jurors did not find that the girl clearly expressed her lack of consent. He was acquitted of the more serious rape charges.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"That does not mean the victim consented to the sexual penetration,\" Judge Larry M. Smukler reminded the court during sentencing, countering Carney's assertion that this was a consensual act between teens. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those sympathetic to Labrie point to the felony computer charge, arguing it was never meant to be applied to texting teenagers. Had Labrie reached out to the girl via phone, he would have been spared a lifetime on the sexual offender registry. Then again, these were no ordinary messages: Labrie and his peers shared email templates and strategies for scoring with younger girls; Labrie even had a list of potential targets, with the girl at the top, in capital letters. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nancy Gertner, a professor at Harvard Law and a former federal judge, has said that in cases where there is some overlap—when online messages between teenagers cross the line from flirtations to calculated targeting—the felony law should be modified, just as Labrie's statutory rape charge was modified to a misdemeanor because of the closeness in age between him and the victim.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Gertner believes the defense still had no business taking the case to trial.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"This was a fundamentally 'untriable' case,\" she tells me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before Labrie found Carney, he went through two other attorneys and <a href=\"http://www.wcvb.com/news/convicted-prep-school-grad-turned-down-lighter-plea-deals/36159920\" target=\"_blank\">refused multiple plea deals</a>—including at least one in which he would have served only a month in jail and done no time on the sex offender's list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the terms of consent may have rested on only the word of two people in a dark room, the evidence that the two had sex was much more hefty. The prosecution presented evidence of semen and DNA, a vaginal tear, testimony, and documents of Labrie's written and spoken assertions to his peers that the two did in fact have sex. Even if Labrie's explanation—dry humping, premature ejaculation, boyish bragging—were true, it's difficult to imagine how he or his attorneys were convinced it would carry the day.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to<em> Vanity Fair, </em>which cited a senior law enforcement source, if at any time during the investigation Labrie acknowledged wrongdoing or regret, he likely would have been sent to a sex-offender diversion program, and never been convicted at all. No jail time, no prolonged public scrutiny. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's what ultimately makes Labrie come off as pathological: his own arrogance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the train this week, Labrie told me what he's said before: Pleading not guilty, instead of quietly settling, was a matter of his belief that he knew the truth. Something he did to sleep at night. Something for which he has no regrets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He continued to praise me and inquire about my chosen profession as an independent writer. I had run into an acquaintance from high school just minutes prior, but somehow meeting Labrie was less awkward. I started to feel bad for him. What if this whole case really was an elaborate plot? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">We got off at South Station in Boston. I took a few steps, and I realized he'd been charming people the same way he did me his entire life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Follow Susan Zalkind on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/susanzalkind\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",

(VINCE BUCCI/AFP/Getty Images)<br></p><p>The LAPD is testing a folding buck knife that was found buried on the perimeter of OJ Simpson's estate, <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/04/oj-simpson-knife-found-murders-nicole-brown/\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to a TMZ report.</p><p>The knife wasn't unearthed just in time for the popular FX Show <em>The People v. OJ Simpson: </em><em>American Crime Story, </em>though. Instead, the blade was apparently discovered by a construction worker as many as 18 years ago, and turned over to an off-duty traffic cop. But instead of, you know, doing the right thing, the officer allegedly took it home with him and stashed it away as a memento of a crazy case.</p><p>According to TMZ, in January, the now-retired cop decided to use the knife to spruce up his home a bit. So he called up a buddy in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division and asked for the Departmental Record (DR) number of the murder case. The idea was to have the knife displayed on his wall with the number engraved on the frame.</p><p>But the guy's cop pal freaked out and told current police officials. The LAPD demanded the retiree turn over the blade, and it is now being tested for hair, fingerprints, and DNA. TMZ reports that a source who's seen the knife thinks it might even have blood residue on it.</p><p>Of course, OJ can't be tried again for the murder, thanks to America's double jeopardy rule. But technically the murder case remains open, since the only real suspect was found not guilty. </p><p>Not that Simpson is necessarily <em>too </em>concerned about new details in his case: The former football star is currently doing time in a Nevada prison for an unrelated <a href=\"http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html\">kidnapping and armed robbery</a> conviction.</p><!--EndFragment-->",

</o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">By most standards, three mass shootings with 13 casualties in a week is a bloody toll. Europe, by comparison, had zero such incidents this week—and has had only seven mass shootings that left six dead and 27 injured this year. But by American standards, this qualifies as a mercifully calm week. It's not the <i>least violent</i> week of 2016; the week bridging the end of January and beginning of February saw just one mass shooting in the US, with only four injuries. But compared to <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/22-people-were-shot-in-five-drive-by-mass-shootings-in-america-this-week\">last week</a>, which saw 12 shootings (including two high-profile random public rampages) that left 20 dead and 41 wounded—over six times as many deaths and over four times as many injuries as Americans experienced this week—the contrast is a stark one. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">There's probably no rhyme or reason for this \"lull.\" Experts have noted in VICE's previous coverage of mass shootings how random they are; <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/more-than-two-dozen-people-got-shot-at-clubs-in-america-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">the types</a> of shooting situations that usually lead to mass casualties can wound almost no one or large groups—depending on a host of incidental factors. We may have been one block, one hour, or one argument away from a much deadlier or a completely bloodless week. It all depends on the vagaries of or around an individual with a gun, which are all but impossible for observers or officers to predict or control in favor of peace. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">All Americans can do is embrace a respite from last week's more serious mass violence. Yet observers ought not allow this comparative calm to dull their awareness of the obscene scale and frequency of mass shootings in the United States. The fact that Americans now have to consider 13 senseless mass shooting casualties (relatively) palatable is appalling—especially given the example offered by our European counterparts.</p><p>Rather than tune out, America might best use this refractory period to meditate on the difference between a calm week here and a standard week in Europe—and the ways in which we might learn to mirror that continent's consistently lower mass shooting casualties.</p><p><o:p></o:p></p><p><em>Follow Mark Hay on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goraladka\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p><!--EndFragment-->",

                "body": "<p>About ten minutes into the eleventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential election, the party's front-runner, Donald J. Trump, reassured Americans about the size of his dick.</p><p>It happened quickly. The first question to Florida Senator Marco Rubio by Fox News anchor, Bret Baier, was about personal attacks—how he's gone, in a matter of weeks, from having a no-Trump-talk policy to more or less implying the man had a small penis. Trump's defense, on Thursday night in Detroit, Michigan: \"I guarantee you, there is no problem.\"</p><p>The moment was the clearest encapsulation of what political discourse has turned into in 2016, and needless to say, it set the tone for the rest of the debate. What followed was two hours of batshit crazy television, in which the remaining Republican candidates not named Donald Trump went balls to the wall against the real estate titan who has all but locked up the party's nomination. Mercifully, there were only four people left on the GOP debate stage—but the shrill shouting match that took place Thursday night had most viewers wishing that lobotomized neurosurgeon Ben Carson hadn't chosen this week to pull out of the race.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In many ways, the debate was a live reenactment of the long-simmering Republican panic, and the near-anabolic shock the party apparatus is currently experiencing, since realizing that Trump could really be the nominee in 2016. Acting as the chorus for this Greek tragedy were the debate moderators—Fox News's Chris Wallace, Brett Baier, and Megyn Kelly—who hammered Trump harder than anyone else on stage, scrutinizing his government spending plans, his blatant policy flip-flops, and those \"minor civil cases\" he faces for scamming students at \"Trump University.\" The trio threw up infographics, played back videos, and even cited court documents, attempting—perhaps in vain—to expose Trump's Achilles heel.</span></p><p>The first question of the night was about former presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who, earlier that day, decried Trump as the death toll of American democracy; a con artist who would plunge the nation into recession, and maybe even World War III. Reiterating his speech to supporters earlier that day, Trump called Romney a \"failed candidate,\" dying for the spotlight. A little later, at the coaxing of the moderators, Trump was once again forced to disavow the Ku Klux Klan. And then there was that dick question.</p><p>As the debate progressed, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz directed their fire at the front-runner, assailing Trump on his donations to Hillary Clinton, on the Trump University fraud cases, and on his business practices in general. \"You argue that you're here to fight for the American worker,\" Rubio basically shouted, \"but when you have a chance to fight for the American worker, you're hiring workers from overseas, and you're making your clothes overseas.\"</p><p>For most of the night, any discussion on serious policy issues devolved into a screaming match, reflecting the rowdy hecklers in the audience who intermittently distracted the candidates by yelling off-camera. Trump casually berated his opponents, referring to Rubio as \"Little Marco\" and to Cruz as \"Lying Ted.\" At times, it was hard to hear what was actually going on over the bickering matches and interruptions.</p><p>Taking place just a couple of days after Trump's routing on Super Tuesday, Thursday's debate was a darker sequel to <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/what-we-learned-from-last-nights-messy-and-bizarre-republican-debate\" target=\"_blank\">last week's face-off in Houston</a>, in which Rubio and Cruz finally eased up on each other and took on their common enemy. With Trump's path to the nomination increasingly set in stone, the need to stop his momentum, and carry the mantle for what's been dubbed the \"Never Trump Movement,\" seemed more dire and imminent Thursday night.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"If you don't want him to be the nominee,\" Cruz stated, in true Cruz fashion, staring at the camera, \"I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, who believe in freedom.\"</span></p><p>Notably, it was Cruz, not Rubio, who made the stronger case for being the best candidate to take on Trump, aided by the fact that the Texas senator won four states on Super Tuesday, compared to Rubio's dismal finish. Cruz's endless mentions of Trump's ties to Clinton, and his call for the reality-television billionaire to release tapes of an off-the-record conversation he had with the <i>New York Times </i>about immigration were aggressive and fresh. When Cruz condescendingly told Trump to \"breathe Donald, just breathe,\" the audience members applauded with him, almost audibly projecting their hopes of beating Trump onto the Texas senator. \"Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth,\" Cruz warned them.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rubio, on the other hand, seemed to be out of new attack lines; nothing he said Thursday seemed to stick—something that kinda needed to happen for him to remain relevant, especially as he trails behind Trump in his home state. His hits against the front-runner were all recycled, except for one on the billionaire businessman's \"flexibility\" on the issues, which included a yoga jab. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, Ohio Governor John Kasich, though still a non-factor in the 2016 race, had his best debate performance yet, in part because he got airtime without having to share stage space with Carson. As he has throughout this election cycle, Kasich leaned into his \"only adult in the room\" routine, refusing to go after rivals and basically begging the party to lighten up. </span></p><p>Whether this eleventh-hour resurrection will actually help Kasich remains to be seen. If the past 10,000 debates have taught us anything, it's that trying to predict the conservative electorate's reaction to these things is a waste of time and internet space. All we can do, really, is sit back and watch as the Republican Party blows itself to pieces.</p><p><em>Follow John Surico on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnSurico\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter.</em></a> </p>",

Before pop culture started borrowing the neon-laced sentiments of raving and predating regular news of kids being hospitalized at big fests due to overdoses, there was a thriving underground rave subculture running through the veins of numerous major cities in North America. This movement was undeniably fueled by several substances, but most notably, <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_us/read/the-evolution-of-ecstasy-in-the-new-millennium\" target=\"_blank\">pressed pills of ecstasy</a>.<br></p><p>As I've been working on modern-day ecstasy stories, I've caught myself daydreaming about what it was like to be part of the scene back in the heyday of raving, and I ended up speaking with two sources who worked together as part of a major ecstasy ring in the United States during the 90s. They were there to witness the shift in rave culture as it began to evolve at the turn of the century.</p><p>Both sources were eventually caught for their involvement, served time, have not taken part in any related activity since, and have agreed to speak to VICE on the basis of anonymity. If you dropped ecstasy in the 90s in the United States, there's a chance you took a pill that came from the very ring they were part of.</p><p><strong>VICE: How did you guys get into this in the first place?</strong></p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6f9aa900-424f-660b-ee8c-a073d9a50a50\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> I was in college, and I hadn't really done any drugs up until that point. I started to get into them—I did acid, and then I did E the first time. We were at a major university in the US where E was just starting to pop up outside of the college scene—more in a subculture scene. I met some people who were hanging out around the college but weren't college students. One guy came up to me in the street outside of my apartment building and gave me a flier for a huge party at an arena.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I'd never been to a rave before, and I went to that first party, took E, acid, probably tweaked a little, and that was the beginning of my introduction to that scene. I was like,<em> Holy shit, there is so much opportunity here. How am I going to be able to find my spot in that scene?</em> And the wheels started to turn. The more raves I went to, the more my contacts and group of friends grew. I had to find E at that point to support just me and my friends and their consumption, and it started to grow from there. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you meet the right person to get you started in the ecstasy business in a very serious way?<br></strong><strong>Jonny: </strong>The initial goal in my early days was to sell as many singles as I could at a party, and that was working out pretty well. I wasn't afraid back then of getting caught or of the whole world knowing my name. I wanted everyone to know who I was and that you could get E from me. At some point, we developed customers who could buy a lot more than we could sell, and at that point, we had to branch out and search for who could supply that much.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At this point, we sort of already had the sources or knew how to get to them, but now, we had the money and the customers, so the sources kind of find you then. If you are a stand-up guy and not bringing heat, then people will want to work with you. I ran into people who ended up being connected to some of the major suppliers in the world.<strong><br></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nick: </strong>By the time everything played out, it was one of the dominant rings. The major drop-off points in the States for ecstasy were LA, New York, and Miami. The reason for that was because those cities had thriving dance industries. In those kinds of cities, you had 30,000 people at parties on weekends taking one or two pills each—you could be talking about 40–50,000 pills on a weekly basis.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny: </strong>We got our E from two main sources. From a non-mafia source, we were getting MDMA in powder form that was, at the time, some of the best E ever sold in the city. That was a market opener for us due to the quality.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How old were you guys during this time?<br></strong><strong>Nick: </strong>Early 20s. In the 90s, both Jonny and I were blowing up as far as our dealing was concerned.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> Yeah, I was about the same age.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was it typically like when you had to go pick up from your source?<br></strong><strong>Nick: </strong><em>[laughs]</em> Don't bring 20s, and don't bring 50s!</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny: </strong>The hard part was the money because we were collecting all this money in 20s most of the time. There were times when I would put $100,000 in cash together and give it out to five different people, then everybody would go to like three different banks all over the town and try to change 20s into 100s.<strong><br></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nick: </strong>I hated that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> After that, I'd put the money together, go to my guy's spot in a nice part of town, chill out, smoke weed, put money in the money counter, and walk out with a designer suitcase filled with tens of thousands of hits of ecstasy. Sometimes, I would go to a shittier apartment with a lot more international gangster-looking types, where I didn't know if I was going to buy E or get jacked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Being a reasonably regular guy, how did you deal with people like that?<br></strong>You had to have a certain type of personality to be accepted by these people. They had to get a good feeling about you; you had to be able to present yourself as a stable individual, not just some fucking drug addict who wanted pills. You had to have a place to move this shit, and you usually had to show up with cash and pay up front.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It was really a progression. I did not like to be fronted because I didn't want to deal with potential repercussions for being fronted. I used that money I saved up from those years of selling singles at raves until me and my partner could get $100,000 together, and it went from there. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When you were smuggling ecstasy to other cities, how would you do it?<br></strong><strong>Nick: </strong>You'd strap it to your legs and go on a plane... It was really weird the way I would do things. I wouldn't even tell anyone which flight I was on. I would call when I got there.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny: </strong>No cell phones, pay phones only, one-way flights booked the day of the trip. We tried not to have a plan, so no one would know when the shipment was going to arrive. Our plan was to not have a plan, so we wouldn't get caught. I'd get a page from a pay phone, then I'd call that pay phone back.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><div class=\"resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/fvN7fKmCoXA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"560px\" data-original-height=\"315px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did the state of the rave scene at that time affect your business?<br></strong><strong>Nick: </strong>I'll be frank. Most of the raves had a serious affiliation with drug dealers—they would even use drugs in the promotion of their events on fliers. This was the beginning of the rave scene fueling the ecstasy distribution, and vice versa.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There were many people in the rave scene who were both promoters and drug dealers. If it wasn't your show, well, you knew the security guards there—you just had to throw them some cash. When you start to expand and everyone knows your stature, things are overlooked because everyone is getting a piece of the action. You're a security guard making what, $14 or $15 an hour tops? You're going to get between $500–$1,000 from me, and you're not going to get that anywhere else. If you look at the rise of the rave scene, it is very easy to see that it correlates to the rise of ecstasy. Not all the big club owners in the country were involved with it, but some were. I mean look at <a href=\"https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/the-comeback-kid-michael-aligs-return-to-new-york-nightlife\" target=\"_blank\">Limelight</a>—that kind of thing wasn't just going on there, that was going on all around the country. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">I think the last show I ever sold pills at, I walked out of there with slightly less than $50,000. There were weekends where I would go to one show, we'd go through the crowd, do a couple hundred or whatever, jump out, go to the next show. I did two or three shows a night. At the end of the night, you could end up with 200–600 pills sold at $20 each. That's up to $12,000 a night. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How much were you guys moving monthly?<br></strong>If we're talking about us and our direct associates: 80,000-100,000 pills. That was average for us. We ended up in places that just didn't have access to it, and the price skyrocketed. At the time, the street price for a hit of ecstasy in one of the cities I went to was $35.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Of the pressed pills you came across during those years, which ones do you remember being the best ones?<br></strong>The Mitsubishis and the Apples.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> The Apples put us on the map at one point. Selling singles at parties, I could sell out 100 single Apples at $20 in 15 minutes. They had by far the best high I had ever had. The only thing better than that was putting the powder MDMA that we got under your tongue, but the Apples were the closest thing to pure we ever saw. The Mitsubishis that came out, they were pretty good, but you could tell they had a little bit of heroin in them... but there were a lot of different versions of those.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There were people below us who wanted to make some money and get in the game, and they got fucked with. There were times I can't believe that these people above me were cool to me or that I walked out of a house because I know other people who had gone over to the same house and they just took their money and told them to go, and that's how it's gonna be. For some reason, I never got robbed, and I always had a good relationship with these people even though I was scared of them. I knew I had to do what I had to do, but for some reason, they just didn't fuck with me. I'm like the least intimidating guy there is, but I think they just liked me for some reason. It was a really weird vibe. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Did you ever have any pills that you weren't happy with the quality, but you still had to unload them?<br></strong><strong>Nick: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>Green Triangles, Hardlines, Happy Faces, and Red Devils were all crappy pills that we sold one time or another but tried to stay away from because they gave you a bad reputation and were hard to sell once the word got out how bad they were. We actually tried to care about what we were selling. We had the quality stuff; people would buy off of me at a rave because they trusted me, and the last time they got from me it was fucking awesome. I'd get to a party, and people would tell me they had been waiting for me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dealing ecstasy at this level obviously sounds like fun in a way since you got to rave all the time, but when did you start to see it going south?<br></strong>There were so many things coming into play that the scene. The vibe was getting dark at raves. More gangsters started showing up. People were getting busted, and it was in the news. There were so many things that were putting raves into the media spotlight, as well as ecstasy and the other drugs behind it.<strong><br></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny: </strong>The rave scene developed into a different animal, more on the track of where it's at today. We went from guys who went to parties to serious dealers. I had to ask myself sometimes if I was willing to get involved with physical violence. The answer for me was always no, but I couldn't tell anyone that because I would get jacked. I started to realize at the end of this that I was going to get arrested and go to jail or I was going to die. All of the sudden I'm not selling pills to people to have a good time; it went from being fun and games to being a serious business.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The rave scene went from a place where you went to hang out with your friends to festivals where millions of dollars are being made. What used to be a couple different people bringing in hundreds or thousands of pills, now organized crime was involved. You had to have the attitude of: If it came down to you and me, it sure as fuck is not going to be me. I personally am lucky I came out of this without hurting anyone. I was in it for the money and the easy life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Were you guys also partaking in doing ecstasy or just selling it?</strong><br><em>[both laugh]<br></em>In the beginning, I was still going out to parties to have fun and do drugs. Then as I started to make money, I would do fewer and fewer drugs. Especially with X, you can't get all X-ed out and sell the amount of drugs we were trying to sell, especially on acid, too. You'd get jacked by somebody or something stupid would happen. At a massive rave, we would sell all the pills we had as fast as possible, then I'd secure the cash either on me somehow where I knew it couldn't get lost or with my girlfriend or with someone I had brought for the purpose of carrying cash. I had people who would carry pills for me too. For a while, I would walk around with nothing. Someone would come up to me and ask for E, and I would be like, \"Awesome, give $20 to that person, and go pick up the pill from that guy.\" Then I'd just walk to the next person.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If all the pills were gone and the money was secured, then sometimes, if it was a massive rave and there were good DJs, we'd pop some pills, do some K, and if it was an outdoor party, we'd candy flip. There's nothing more fun than making a fuckton of money in a night and fucking candy flipping, having a few beers, listening to a god DJ, and watching the sunrise. It doesn't get any better than that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nick: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>You had to have a way with words to do this kind of thing. You had to be one of the top people socially to be able to do that—look and play the part.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> I knew Nick from the beginning of my rave days, and our relationship grew over the course of it. He was promoting and connected to DJs and guys who threw parties when I was just going to raves. Then I started to sell, and Nick became more of a resource at that point. As I got my operation built up and we had made a lot of money, Nick was another person who was moving a lot of this stuff back home.<strong><br></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nick:</strong> At a certain point, Jonny stopped going out on the weekends. He was making so much money on the big deals that he didn't care. He just wanted to enjoy himself and faded out. I kept at it. I had runners. I would show up with 500 pills on me in my underwear, and had another 1,000 in a booth inside the party. I'd have all the gay boys and certain little clicks of the rave scene all out working for me.<strong><br></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jonny:</strong> I didn't want to risk going to raves and getting caught at that point. I haven't been to a rave in I don't know how long, but I know it's not like it used to be. Now when kids take ecstasy, they might die. Back then, there was a level of purity to the scene; it was like a young movement where anyone and everyone could go to a rave and have an experience like some of your parents did at Woodstock. Just like the 60s and the 70s will never repeat themselves, the late 80s to the early 2000s will never happen again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </em><em>Names, places, and other details have been changed to protect anonymity.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Follow Allison Elkin on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allison_elkin\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em> </p></span>",

(Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images For alice + olivia by Stacey Bendet) </p><p>At <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/what-we-learned-from-last-nights-horrifying-republican-debate\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday night's Republican debate</a>, the candidates didn't really get into the nitty-gritty of policy—the Fox News broadcast instead focused on personal attacks, the size of front-runner Donald Trump's penis, and incoherent shouting about polls. That's par for the course, as this year's GOP primary campaign has been all about insults and noise. Still, you couldn't help but wonder why the moderators didn't save a question to tackle Trump's seven-point <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform\" target=\"_blank\">health care plan</a>, which was posted to his campaign website on Wednesday and goes into a surprising amount of detail given that the real estate mogul has been notoriously light on which policies he would actually push as president. </p><p>The plan includes some items that are on most Republican wish lists when it comes to health care reform, including the repeal of Obamacare and removing restrictions on how Medicaid money is spent. But it also features some proposals guaranteed to piss big pharma companies off, like the recommendation that rules against importing prescription drugs be loosened. </p><p>But when you add it all up, what do you get? To go into more detail about Trump's plan, we called up Gerald F. Kominski, a professor who is the director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research*. He said that there were some good points, but in the end, \"we'll be much worse off because of this proposal.\" </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>VICE: Let's start with the basics: Why this demand at the top that Obamacare be repealed?<br></strong></span><strong>Gerald F. Kominski: </strong>The simplest thing is that he's running as a Republican. Republicans made Obamacare the lightning rod for everything that's wrong with the United States. Like, <i>It's responsible for global warming, air pollution</i>. It's just a blanket hatred of this law. In order for him to appeal to a Republican base, he's gotta say that this is a horrible law. He's just being consistent with what Republicans have been saying for the past six years. </p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>If he wanted to, couldn't he make alterations to Obamacare instead of repealing it?<br></strong>He absolutely could do that. I think the reason he's not doing it is because he's strategically decided that will cost him votes. So, like he does on a lot of things, he's just going all in. That's his style. </p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>What about the second point, which calls for allowing companies to sell insurance across state lines? That's another talking point for Republicans, right?<br></strong>Right now, insurance companies have difficulties marketing a product across the country. Health insurance is largely regulated at the state level. And there's federal law that protects the states' right to regulate health insurance. What he's saying—and Republicans have proposed this over the years—is, \"Let's get rid of the state regulation of health insurance. Let's just let insurance companies do business in any state that they want to.\" </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>So it's in line with his free-enterprise rhetoric.<br></strong></span>Exactly. This way, you guarantee that the minimal possible regulations rule nationally. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>His third point would allow people to deduct health insurance premiums from their taxes, and the plan points out,</strong><strong> \"</strong></span><strong>Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn't Congress allow individuals the same exemptions?\" That doesn't sound too bad to me, actually.<br></strong>It's not an unreasonable proposal. I think the biggest shortcoming of this is that it will increase the federal deficit. Basically, it means that people won't be paying taxes [on health insurance]. Individuals who get their insurance through work already are exempt from taxes. The health insurance premiums that you pay at work for many people are exempt from taxes right now. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i></i></span> </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tell me about \"price transparency,\" which is one of the other things Trump proposes. </strong></span><br>Of all the things he proposes, this is the one I agree with the most. I really don't like most of the aspects of this [plan], but what he's saying is, right now, when people pay for health care services, it's hard to get any good information about what it's gonna cost. If you try to look on the internet and do some comparison shopping, it's hard to find the information, and it's not always very reliable. </p><p class=\"p2\">One of the problems with hospitals and health care is that they will bill you a certain amount for their services, but then end of up accepting much less than the bill amount as their final payment. What he's saying—and what a lot of people in our field have been saying for years now—is that what really matters is what doctors and hospitals except as their final payment, not what they bill or charge for their service. Think about buying a car: You get a sticker price, but then there's what you actually pay, and hopefully you're a good enough negotiator that you pay less than that price. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>How have companies been getting away with being secretive?<br></strong></span>I think it's a long story, but the short answer is they can, but they don't have to provide the information. So they don't. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Trump also wants \"b</strong></span><strong>lock-grant Medicaid to the states.\" That would mean removing the restrictions the federal government places on how Medicaid money is spent by the states, right?<br></strong>Creating block grants is something Republicans have wanted to do for a long time. [The idea is], <i>Look, the federal government is just going to give you money so you could run the program any way you want. We're not going to give you a lot requirements; we're just going to give you the freedom to spend that money in lots of different ways</i>. Republicans think that this is the way to fix Medicaid because it gives states more flexibility. The concern is that if the federal government doesn't hold the states to some standard, they could spend that money in a way that really wouldn't necessarily serve low-income people very well—which is the purpose of the Medicaid program. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The final point is a call to \"remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable, and cheaper products.\" What's at stake here?<br></strong></span>I think what he's signaling here is that he wants to say, <i>Look</i>, <i>we ought to be able to import drugs from other countries where they're cheaper. </i>There are currently barriers to do that because the companies manufacturing pharmaceuticals around the world are not necessarily subject to the FDA regulations. There's possible safety concerns—however, what he's saying is that if we could figure out a way to guarantee that something made in India is safe, then we ought to be able to import those drugs, because that will drive prices down. The same drug in India is much less expensive than the drug being sold here. </p><p class=\"p2\">If you can guarantee safety, it's not a bad idea at all. It's just an issue of guaranteeing. </p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>So what would happen if all these proposals became reality?<br></strong></span>Repealing Obamacare and the other aspects that he's proposing will basically rewind the clock to where we were in the early part of the 2000s. More people are going to be struggling to get coverage, and we're potentially going to unravel the progress that we've made. The people with the lowest incomes, who now have expanded access to Medicaid—switching to a block grant program is likely to allow states to push more people off of their Medicaid program. I think overall, we'll be much worse off because of this proposal. </p><p><em>Follow Brian Josephs on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bklyn_Rock\">Twitter</a></em>.<br> </p><p><strong><em>Correction 3/4:</em></strong><em> An earlier version of this article misstated Kominski's title at the </em><em>UCLA Center for Health Policy Research</em></p>",

Stephen Jackley took it a little further. While others at his college were joining left-wing student groups and painting placards, he was planning armed robberies on banks and building societies, with the intention of donating a portion of the takings to charity. </p><p>Jackley, who has Asperger's syndrome, was obsessed with Robin Hood. He viewed the man in the little felt hat as an icon of anti-capitalism, and thought he'd emulate his tactics as a way of righting capitalism's wrongs. At the peak of his crime spree, in fact, he went as far as writing a letter to local paper that read: \"I will continue to take from the rich and give to the poor,\" signing it \"RH.\" </p><p>Following his arrest and imprisonment, reports painted Jackley as everything from a violent psychopath who used anti-capitalism as an excuse, to an eccentric loner lost in a fantasy world. The reality was a little more complex. </p><p>Jackley grew up in southern England as the son of a painter and an engineer. His mother suffered from schizophrenia and was regularly being hauled away by either police or medics. Jackley blames his inability to trust or get particularly close to anyone as an adult on this part of his childhood. </p><p>As he was approaching late adolescence, he had the realization that a lot of teenagers tend to have: The world is a systematically unfair place. Traveling through Southeast Asia—a rare luxury in itself—this inequality was illustrated in front of him in the shape of all the four-star hotels built within a mile of shanty towns with no running water. </p><p>Back in the UK, and studying geography at the University of Worcester, Jackley got pretty into drugs and alcohol, specifically weed and cocaine. In 2007, living in student halls, the 21-year-old began devising his plan to make society more equal. </p><p>A number of studies have been done about the relationship between Asperger's syndrome and crime. Experts have failed to agree on whether or not people with the disorder are more likely to commit crimes than anyone else, but most suggest that it may affect how crimes they do commit are carried out. </p><p>When I asked this, Jackley says that his Asperger's played a role in his decision to go ahead with the robberies, \"insofar as my inability to understand the effects of my actions upon others.\" However, it seems that a desire to be viewed in a heroic light had an equally significant part to play. </p><p>\"I wanted to donate at least 60 percent to homeless people and charity,\" says Jackley. \"I saw myself as a Robin Hood figure, which I used to justify what I did. Altogether, I donated around £2,000 [$2,819] to charity, which doesn't sound like a lot, but my intention was to donate more. I also gave to homeless people. This is going to sound crazy, but I marked the notes with an 'RH.'\" </p><p>Unfortunately for Jackley, on one job he actually ended up doing the exact opposite of what he'd set out to achieve. \"On one occasion, I burgled a premises, and it turned out to be a charity office, which I hadn't realized at the time. That was a nightmare. I gave the charity incremental sums, starting with £250 [$352] and eventually going up to £750 [$1,057],\" he says. \"I was going to keep increasing the amount until I reached about £20,000 [$28,193].\" </p><p>Looking back on his actions, Jackley seems to comprehend the absurdity of it all. He's affable and relaxed, and it's easy, speaking to him, to forget that this is a man who used hammers, knives, and imitation guns to hold up bookies, building societies, and banks. But his remorse seems genuine. He says that while his intentions were, in part, altruistic, he regrets what he did and the terror he caused the people who witnessed his robberies. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/stephen-jackley-robin-hood-bank-roober-body-image-1457028448.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"640\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-model-id=\"152754\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"stephen-jackley-robin-hood-bank-roober-body-image-1457028448.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">CCTV images of Jackley in disguise </p><p>After a string of successful heists, Jackley decided he wanted to use a real gun for future crimes, so he set off to the US to buy one that he could smuggle back to the UK. This plan was foiled almost before it had begun: The owner of the shop he tried to buy a gun from was a former police officer who immediately recognized his ID as fake. </p><p>After the shop owner reported Jackley to the police, officers searched him and found his University of Worcester student card, before alerting the local force in the UK, and suggesting that officers search his student accommodation. There, the cops found items linking him to the robberies—weapons, disguises, notes about past and planned hold-ups—and, bizarrely, an imitation bomb (Jackley claims he doesn't know what his intentions for the fake bomb were because he was drunk and high when he decided to keep it in his room). </p><p>British papers pounced and dubbed Jackley the \"Robin Hood armed robber.\" For the time being, a trial by media was all he'd get in the UK; a judge in Vermont sentenced him to ten months imprisonment for trying to buy a firearm with a fake ID, and he spent the next few months being shifted around several different prisons. </p><p>\"I kept getting asked if I knew the Queen, and the only place the prisoners knew about was London,\" he says. \"A lot of them were quite decent. I got most hassle from the guards.\"<br> </p><hr><p><strong><em>Related: Watch our documentary 'Murder, Mayhem, and Meditation'<br><br></em></strong> </p><div class=\"resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RzOkf-mrDbM\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"100%px\" data-original-height=\"360px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><hr><p>In 2009, at age 23, Jackley was deported to the UK and charged at Worcester Crown Court with 21 different offenses, including robbery, attempted robbery, and firearms possession. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges and was sentenced to 13 years in jail, a sentence that was appealed and later shortened to 12 years after judges at London's Criminal Appeal Court said his Asperger's syndrome may have caused his \"awareness of the consequences of his actions—and therefore his culpability—[to have] been significantly impaired.\" </p><p>Jackley was released in 2014, and with the help of the Prince's Trust, has since set up the publishing company Arkbound and founded the magazine <em>Boundless</em>, which focuses on sustainable living and social inclusion. </p><p>Speaking to him now, it's clear he's neither the deluded menace the press made him out to be nor is he a man who still believes he's an anti-capitalist crusader who has to commit crimes to somehow tackle economic disparity. He says life since being released from prison has been \"difficult and enlightening,\" but there's no doubt he's trying to make amends for what he's done in the past. The Robin Hood days are long behind him. Now, he's doing his best to address inequality with words, not hammers. </p><p><em>Jackley has released a book about his crimes entitled </em>Just Sky<em>, which is available via his publishing company, <a href=\"http://arkbound.com/featured-books/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkbound</a>.</em> </p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickchesterv\"></a><em>Follow Nick Chester on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickchesterv\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",

All photos by Dennis Morris </p><p> Dennis Morris is the Forrest Gump of British pop culture. </p><p>Gump moved through the world uncannily connecting with the cultural moment: teaching Elvis how to pelvis, phoning in Watergate, inventing jogging. Morris was 11 years old when a chance photo he took of a PLO leader ended up in the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. As a 16-years-old, he was in the right place to take a photo of Bob Marley with a spliff that now adorns a million bedroom walls. Through that, he became court photographer to the Sex Pistols, then the A&R man who signed the Slits and Lynton Kwesi Johnson. He designed Public Image Limited's iconic <em>Metal Box</em> album, shot the cover for Marianne Faithfull's <em>Broken English</em>, put on the Stone Roses' first ever London gig, and his own band, Basement 5, were some of the first black faces in a white-dominated British punk scene. All this from a Hackney boy with no dad who was told by his school career counselor that there was \"no such thing as a black photographer.\" </p><p>When we heard a retrospective of his PiL shots were being shown at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts at the end of March, it seemed like a good time to load up the dictaphone, go down to his London studio, point it in his general direction, and come back groaning under the weight of culturally-important anecdotes. </p><p class=\"photo-credit has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093196.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"796\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-model-id=\"153036\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093196.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"><br>John Lydon in Jamaica, 1978 </p><p><strong>VICE: Hi Dennis. In 1978, you went on holiday to Jamaica with Richard Branson and John Lydon, just after he'd broken up the Sex Pistols. Was that a sitcom in the making?</strong><br><strong>Dennis Morris:</strong> That was such a great, great vibe. We landed at Kingston Airport, and this group of rastas saw John and said: \"Johnny Rotten, <em>mon</em>! God Save the Queen, <em>mon</em>!\", and I knew it was going to be a great time. </p><p><strong>Why were you there?</strong> <br>Virgin Records decided to get involved in reggae, and they wanted me to go out there with Richard. So I then turned to them in the meeting and said, \"Why don't we take John? He's a big reggae fan. And he just left the Pistols...\" So the three of us went out there. </p><p><strong>So you were you there shopping for new artists? </strong><br>It was amazing. We'd sit in the Sheraton Hotel, and the big local music producers would come and visit us. We'd say, \"How much do you want?\" And they'd name a figure. Then Richard would say, \"OK, come back tomorrow.\" And then he'd have the money ready for them, in cash. One of the big things they loved about Richard and Virgin was that they'd get cash in hand. Word spread. So soon every reggae artist in Jamaica was queueing outside the Sheraton.<br> </p><p class=\"photo-credit has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093243-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"791\" data-model-id=\"153037\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093243.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"><br>John Lydon in U-Roy's backyard, 1978 </p><p><strong>Partly as a result of that trip, when you got back to England, your friend Johnny went full-bore into his new thing: Public Image Limited, climaxing in its debut show on Christmas Day at the Rainbow Theater. You were producing the show. What was the weight of expectation like?<br></strong>That gig was absolute chaos. It was all self-financed, which was unheard of, and of course playing on Christmas Day was completely unheard of. Even when it came down to the gig itself, it was shaky. Jah Wobble couldn't play his bass standing up because he was still learning it. And everyone thought, <em>Wow, that's so radical, sitting down</em>. Lydon had the lyrics written out on sheets on a lectern. And again everyone thought, <em>Wow, cool, this is the new thing</em>... </p><p><strong>Is it true that your career counselor at school told you that there was \"no such thing\" as a black photographer? </strong><br>The counselor asked me, \"What do you want to do?\" and I said I wanna be a photographer. And the counselor said, \"Don't be stupid boy, there's no such thing as a black photographer.\" So I started listing black photographers who'd inspired me. And the counselor said, \"Do you wanna be like a wedding photographer?\" I said, \"No, I don't wanna do weddings. I wanna be a photographer.\" It was a kinda struggle for me. I wasn't getting anywhere for a while and that's when the family starts putting on pressure to get a proper job. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093333-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"802\" data-model-id=\"153038\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093333.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>When did you finally work past that \"pressure to get a proper job\"? <br></strong>Probably when I started working with Bob Marley. </p><p><strong>But you started that when you were 16?<br></strong>Yes. You know, I remember Jah Wobble saying to me, when he was in PiL, the wages were $28 a week. When he went home, his dad was so pissed off that he was earning more than him. </p><p><strong>You released a book of photographs from your own early years in the 60s and 70s called <em>Growing Up Black</em>. What was it like growing up black? </strong><br>The title comes from the fact that when I was growing up, we were called \"colored people.\" And then, the black power movement came from America, and we all wanted to be black, not \"colored\" like our parents' generation. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457095938.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"734\" data-original-height=\"978\" data-model-id=\"153091\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457095938.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">The man himself </p><p><strong>You grew up in Hackney. What do you think of its makeover? <br></strong>Hackney's one of those places now where the real inhabitants don't really have a say. </p><p><strong>Do you mourn that? </strong><br>It's not that I mourn it. It's just something that happens. Bill Clinton has his office in Brooklyn now. Years ago, no white people would go there.<br><br> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093380.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"808\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-model-id=\"153039\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093380.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p><strong>You took that legendary photo series of Bob Marley smoking a massive spliff—the one that's on a million students' dorm walls. It's a pretty big spliff. Was there any visual trickery involved in the making of it?<br></strong>Haha. It was completely natural. One day he said to me, \"Dennis, let me show you how to smoke a spliff.\" I shot one, two, three frames. By the fourth frame, I was gone. I was completely high. </p><p><strong>Is it very financially rewarding to own a piece of history like that? The reprint rights must be stratospheric.</strong><br>That picture has now become like the Che Guevara picture. So it's almost like in public domain. I can't control it. </p><p><strong>You mean you don't make anything off it?</strong><br>I can't control it. It's in the public domain. </p><p><strong>You were also there at the historic moment when Bob Marley saw snow for the first time.</strong><br>That happened again on that first tour in 1973. They opened the curtains in a hotel one day, and it was snowing. Peter Tosh said, \"What's that?\" And I said, \"Well, it's snow.\" They weren't very happy with that, and Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer said it was a sign from Jah that they should leave the tour. So they went home. </p><p><strong>They went home?</strong><br>Yeah, they hated it here. They were miserable. </p><p><strong>Why did they hate England?</strong><br>Lots of things. One was that they hated the cold. They wanted their home food, which was vegan and you definitely couldn't get that here back then. But Bob was determined, because he felt that he had a message to deliver. So he came back two years later to tour with a different band and that's when he did <em>Live!</em> at the Lyceum and everything took off for him.<br><br> </p><p class=\"photo-credit has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093432-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"799\" data-model-id=\"153042\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093432.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"><br>PiL on John Lydon's Roof, 1978 </p><p><strong>Even back in those Bob Marley shots, your style has always felt like more like reportage than music photography. I read a quote from you saying you wanted to be a war photographer. That casual, unposed, style is obviously very common now, but I guess no one was really doing that at the time.</strong><br>Yeah my reportage style wasn't the thing in music photography then. But I was obsessed with people like Don McCullin and Robert Capa. They were my heroes. I took that influence, that style. I used a Leica. No one used a Leica then. </p><p><strong>What's a Leica?</strong><br>It's a German camera brand. The original 35mm camera was a Leica. Very difficult to use in rock photography when you've got something moving, but very small so you can take it anywhere, and no one takes it seriously. So you get them to open up. </p><p><strong>Is there an art to being that kind of sneak?</strong><br>You find a way of being invisible. Fitting in so people are not aware of you. Ninety-nine percent of those pictures I took from Marley to the Pistols, I didn't use flash. </p><p><strong>Would you say you're good at fitting in, making yourself inconspicuous?<br></strong>I'm very good at fitting in. My wife says to me, \"You don't speak Japanese, but you do speak Japanese.\" Because I've found a way to fit in over there when I'm working where words don't matter. </p><p><strong>You just have a plausible manner. </strong><br>For instance, I did a body of work in Southall, documenting the Sikh community there. And when it came to the exhibition, this old Sikh man said to me, \"These are very good. Who is the photographer?\" And I said it's me. And he paused and said, \"But you know, we have a problem. How did you get through the doors?\" I said, \"Well you know, I just knocked on the doors.\" I've been in some very strange places. Because people look at me, and they think, <em>he's harmless</em>.<br> </p><p class=\"photo-credit has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093507-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1200\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-model-id=\"153044\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/04/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/04/\" data-image-filename=\"dennis-morris-photographer-interview-body-image-1457093507.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"><br>The Slits </p><p><strong>Does that sort of sneaking around ever backfire? <br></strong>Well, I've been shot at a few times. </p><p><strong>Really? <br></strong>One time in Jamaica, a manager came in and put a gun in my face and threatened me. And I just said, \"Do it. Pull the trigger.\" </p><p><strong>Did he really need that kind of provocation?<br></strong>Well, he put the gun down. </p><p><strong>That was lucky.<br></strong>Because it confused him. He didn't know what to do then. He was really expecting me to crumble and beg. But it was a chance—I took that gamble. </p><p><strong>Speaking of unhinged men with guns, your Basement 5 albums were produced by Martin Hannett, who of course famously tried to shoot Tony Wilson...</strong><br>Oh my God, what an absolute genius. One day he said to me, \"You know, Dennis, one day they will give away magazines and newspapers!\" I mean, his biggest problem was the drugs. </p><p><strong>When you were in the Basement 5, what was the reaction of the black audiences who went to see you?</strong><br>They hated us. They kept expecting us to be a reggae band! I used to have a mohican, and when black people saw me, they'd cross the street because they just thought I was an absolute lunatic. </p><p><strong>Basement 5 also signed to Island Records at the same time as U2.<br></strong>Yeah. They used to support us. They  used to watch us from side of stage. Now, our guitarist, we called him JR. He used to wear a cowboy hat. Played a Gibson Flying V. I used to climb up on the PA and do all of that stuff that Bono did. Beware of the support band! </p><p><strong>Your next project, drum 'n' bass group </strong><strong>Urban Shakedown,</strong> <strong>was signed to Paul Weller's label. Then, by the late 80s, you were doing a rap thing. Are you  good at spotting a gap in the market? <br></strong>I was just exploring the avenues of a certain amount of success. The first Sex Pistols photo book, for instance, <em>Bollocks</em>, I published myself. Because I went to Virgin, and the guy who was the head of books said: \"Oh, punk's finished.\" So I did it myself. I made it square, the same size as an album, so you could rack it with your records. I printed 2000. And for the first week, I had 2,000 books stacked in my house. Then, boom, they all went. It just flew. So all these things, I had to find a way to market myself. </p><p><strong>You've been shooting the band Skinny Girl Diet today. Why did you want to work with them? </strong><br>I've worked with a lot of female bands. L7. The Slits. I love that look. I love that energy. </p><p><strong>What other things are you up to at the moment? <br></strong>I've revived my music again. I've been working with Billy Morrison, who is Billy Idol's guitarist, and one of the Queens of the Stone Age, and Twiggy Ramirez from Marilyn Manson's band, and we've just done a track, working under the banner of D5. </p><p><strong>Within the breadth of what you've done, what one bit do you consider your legacy? What single thread do you want to leave the planet with? </strong><br>It's very difficult to say. I have certain people totally in love with my music. For some people, it's the reggae side. Others, it's the punk side. The reportage stuff. In Japan, they call me \"Living Legend.\" </p><p><strong>Sorry, why do they call you that?<br></strong>Oh man, in Japan, it's like Beatlemania when I step off the plane... </p><p><strong>But a polite, respectful Beatlemania.<br></strong>Definitely. </p><p><strong>So, um, to get back to the question, what's your legacy?<br></strong>It's very difficult for me. Someone asked me the other day what do I do—I said \"I shoot people. You know <em>American Sniper</em>? I'm Jamaican Sniper. I shoot people. The phone rings. I pick it up. I pack my bags. I shoot people. I come back.\" </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Dennis Morris:<i> PiL—First Issue to Metal Box<em> is showing at the ICA in London from March 22 to May 15.</em></i></span><br> </p><p> <em>Follow Gavin Haynes on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gavhaynes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter.</a> </em> <br><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br></span></strong> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p>",

(AP Photo/LM Otero) </p><p>Upon entering administrative segregation—a.k.a. solitary—at Mark W. Michael Unit, a prison in east Texas, I was escorted down a long hallway. I saw a small infirmary, a smaller visitation booth, and a kitchen. Then we turned down a corridor and headed toward my block.<br> </p><p>\"What's that smell?!\" I shouted. </p><p>Sitting at the door to the cell block were four milk cartons, each containing a brown liquid. Before I had time to process what I was looking at, I got my answer. </p><p>\"It's shit,\" one of the guards said, just as calmly as if he were telling me what time it was. \"Welcome to the shithouse.\" </p><p>When the door opened, the full force of the odor hit me like a brick. I couldn't believe these four cartons of feces were just sitting there... like <em>that</em>. Why hadn't one of the inmate janitors taken them and flushed them? What kind of place was this? </p><p>Ad-seg, as we call it, works in levels. You can start out in Level 3, and after 30 days with no disciplinary infractions, you can be promoted to Level 2, where you can have two visits per month. After 60 days there, you receive all of your personal property and go to Level 1, where you can buy food items and coffee from commissary. </p><p>But it's back on Level 3 that you find the kind of people who defecate into milk cartons. </p><p>The facility is designed to break you. It houses some of the most dangerous people in Texas, as well as some of the most mentally-disturbed. I immediately feared that I would soon find myself turning into them, by virtue of my proximity. </p><p>I understood that only the strongest men can spend full days among lunatics and not become one. </p><p>My neighbor spent hours at a time kicking his door for no apparent reason. Yells came from down the corridor as I slept. And there was a nagging voice I heard at the same time every day, like some sort of chant or incantation, unnerving in its consistency. </p><p>I began to memorize it: \"Attention F-Pod, this is Rabbi Shepard,\" it always began. \"I live in F-Pod, 65 Cell. My TDC number is 599999. This is no time to bring children into the world. Warden Moore works for Satan, and Lieutenant Holder is their servant. The snitches on this unit are Black Major, Easy Black-E, and Whiteboy Snow. Do not drink the water after 7 PM. If you want to go to PAMEO, a safer place, hang a sign on your door that says, 'I AM A PEDOPHILE,' shave your head, and toss shit on the first black nurse you see. They took Morris from 62 Cell and never brought him back.\" </p><p>I eventually learned that the four cartons of feces that greeted me were the rabbi's doing. The cartons, apparently, were known as \"bullets,\" and they were thrown at guards—a practice called \"shit-chunking.\" Since inmates had no other weapon, they attacked their enemies with what their own bodies could provide. </p><p>The serious \"chunkers,\" like the rabbi, kept an arsenal of three or four missiles at the ready. The less psychotic would load one when needed. </p><p>But the only time these projectiles were actually used was when a guard opened up the food slot, where trays and mail got inserted. Often, the inmate would hurl as many bullets as possible before the guard could scramble away. </p><p>All of this sounds sick, I know. I never condoned chunking nor did it. But this was my introduction to the Ad-seg experience. This is what happens in prisons. </p><p>What people on the outside don't always understand is that most of us in here will, one day, be released. </p><p><em>Jeremy Busby is a 38-year-old inmate now incarcerated at another state prison called Ramsey Unit in Rosharon, Texas, where he's serving a 75-year sentence for a murder he committed when he was 21.</em> </p><img src=\"https://d18glvfsbyiquw.cloudfront.net/p.gif?v=nj1&slug=vice_20160304_lifeinside_POOH\">",

                "body": "<p>We've been wandering around a nondescript industrial lot in northern Berlin for about ten minutes when we finally spot them by a gate: Two men, built like bouncers—in leather cut-off jackets, their hair cropped very short. We approach them a tad uncomfortably, and they shake our hands without smiling. \"Just go around the back to the little door. They'll give you a warm welcome there,\" one of them says, grinning. I start to wonder whether it was a mistake to arrange to meet the Osmanen Germania—the Germania Ottomans, in English. They're Germany's latest biker gang. </p><p>The group—whose name combines both the Ottoman and the German empires in allusion to its many members with Turkish background—was virtually unknown to the public until very recently. That changed when on the evening of January 25, around 80 members of the Germania Ottomans met in the city of Neuss and <a href=\"http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duisburg/osmanen-germania-versammeln-sich-in-duisburg-aid-1.5724641\" target=\"_blank\">another 40 gathered in Duisburg</a> two days later. The media went all out with it: \"<a href=\"http://www.express.de/duesseldorf/-osmanen-germania--duesseldorf-droht-ein-neuer-rocker-krieg-23430256\" target=\"_blank\">New Biker War Threatens Düsseldorf</a>,\" one local newspaper's headline read. Other headlines included \"<a href=\"http://www.bild.de/news/inland/news-inland/schon-20-charter-gegruendet-osmanen-rocker-breiten-sich-in-deutschland-aus-44385660.bild.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ottoman Bikers Expanding in Germany</a> (<i>Bild</i>)\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article151711765/Rockergruppe-Osmanen-Germania-waechst-rasant.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Osmanen Germania Biker Gang Is Growing Rapidly</a> (<i>Die Welt)</i>.\"</p><p>All articles seemed sure of one thing: the Germania Ottomans are an aggressively expanding biker gang claiming a cut from what are normally considered traditional ventures of the established biker gangs. \"The new biker gang is advancing more and more into red-light districts, which increases the likelihood of a bloody territorial battle with established gangs like the Hells Angels and the Mongols,\" reported the <i><a href=\"http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Panorama/Uebersicht/Osmanen-draengen-ins-Rotlichtmilieu-und-fordern-Rockerclubs-heraus\" target=\"_blank\">Hannoversche Allgemeine</a></i>, only to qualify in the next sentence: \"Experts on biker culture warn that it is important not to overreact and spread an unnecessary panic.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457011615-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"152630\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457011615.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>The police in North Rhine-Westphalia are considerably more reserved: \"We're still in a state of acquiring intelligence,\" says Klaus Zimmermann, spokesperson for the organized crime division of North Rhine-Westphalia's state police. The police might not be talking about \"biker wars,\" but they are taking the new group seriously: \"We can't eliminate the possibility of conflicts. We've seen that happen repeatedly when hostile gangs set up shop in another gang's territory with the intention of doing business.\" </p><p>But are the Germania Ottomans interested in that kind of business? According to Zimmermann, there's no concrete evidence supporting that yet. The group is still young and hasn't really made its mark yet. But at least on Facebook, members of the Germania Ottomans vehemently deny being a criminal biker gang. \"We started the Germania Ottomans in order to give something back, not to take anything away from anyone,\" one of the group's founders, Selcuk S., writes on Facebook. Other members also emphasize that the Germania Ottomans are not a biker gang. In fact, the members like to point out that they're not an MC (motorcycle club) but a BC—a boxing club.</p><p>So is the German media panicking over nothing? Are the Germania Ottomans just a sports club with a wild name? If so, why the outfits? The Germania Ottomans haven't been quick to run to the press to answer these questions: The only interview given so far was to <a href=\"https://2010sdafrika.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/die-altrocker-haben-uns-nichts-zu-sagen/\" target=\"_blank\">a relatively obscure insider website</a>. </p><p>Which made it so surprising that the group not only responded to my email but also invited me to its clubhouse. Apparently, the Germania Ottomans now want to take control of its public image. </p><p>The little door opens, and we are led through a well-lit hallway, into a very tidy gym. There are about six men in leather cut-off jackets, most of them with the same build as the two guys we met outside. They all shake our hands, and one of them—who, according to his jacket, is the \"road captain\"—shows us around the brand new gym while we wait for the group's president. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457011641.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152631\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457011641.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Tiger, president of the Berlin chapter and world sergeant of the Germania Ottomans<br> </p><p>The Berlin president, who's even bigger than the others, wants to be called \"Tiger.\" He's also the Germania Ottomans' world sergeant—which means that he's one of the most important men in the club, after founders Selcuk S. and Mehmet B. We're sitting in some kind of rec room, when he explains to us how he sees the Germania Ottomans. \"We're a boxing club. We're about sports, nothing more.\" Apparently, they all wear the jackets to be able to recognize each other. \"The media only writes trash about us,\" he maintains. \"It's all lies.\"</p><p> <div class=\"resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/psfMLKIjGTY\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"100%px\" data-original-height=\"360px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </p><p class=\"photo-credit\">The tone of this video might be a bit aggressive, but I am told that's the whole point with hip-hop videos. As one member of the Germania Ottomans explains to me: \"When [rapper] Bushido sings that he's going to kill someone, he's not actually going to kill someone.\" </p><p>\"The biker scene in Germany is shifting—which is partly why the rise of the Germania Ottomans are causing such a stir,\" explains Stephan Strehlow, the head of Berlin's police division fighting biker crime and crimes related to prostitution. \"<span class=\"s2\">On the one hand, you have the old school bikers, mostly German, who are closely bound to the idea of biker code,\" </span>he explains. \"Emerging biker groups are made up primarily of people with immigrant backgrounds or of other nationalities, who have a different understanding of what it means to be a biker.\" For a lot of these new biker groups, membership is a way to get respect and to commit crimes under the protection of a larger group. </p><p>One example of this last kind of biker is career criminal Kadir P.—from Berlin's Hells Angels—who is currently facing a murder charge for having a rival killed with eight bullets. He was originally recruited by the Bandidos gang, but when he noticed that the Hells Angels were increasing in numbers in Berlin, he abruptly took all his followers and crossed over. He was accepted almost instantly, even though he had just led a brutal attack on the Hells Angels, in which one biker almost had a leg hacked off with a machete and the boss of Berlin's Hells Angels, André S., <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/de/read/die-spaltung-der-deutschen-hells-angels-old-school-rocker-gegen-newbies-mit-migrationshintergrund-111\" target=\"_blank\">was stabbed in the back</a>—literally. </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012109-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"152633\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012109.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>Another important reason for the way the Germania Ottomans are being perceived is a recent escalation of the tension between old school bikers and bikers with immigrant backgrounds, in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia. In July 2014, the leader of Frankfurt's Hells Angels, Schnitzel Walter, forbade the ambitious member Aygün M. from venturing out on his own and starting his own chapter in Giessen. When Aygün M. stole some bouncer contracts to boot, Walter responded with a shoot out in front of Frankfurt's Katana Club, which <a href=\"http://www.fnp.de/lokales/frankfurt/Ist-der-Rockerkrieg-in-Frankfurt-abgewendet;art675,1512200\" target=\"_blank\">left five bikers dead</a>. </p><p>Things have since calmed down in Hesse, after an intervention from International Hells Angels. Aygün M. was allowed to keep his chapter in Giessen, which is now considered<span class=\"s3\"> a hangout of the infamous, former \"Godfather of Cologne\"—\"Neco\" Arabaci, who was released in 2007 after a six year prison sentence in Turkey.</span> <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/rocker-hells-angels-bekriegen-sich-gegenseitig-a-938965.html\" target=\"_blank\">Back in 2013</a>, <em>Der Spiegel </em>reported that the Nomads Turkey—a Hells Angels sub-chapter run by Neco—was behind an attack on the Hells Angels in Krefeld, directed by Arabaci. </p><p>According to newspaper <i>Der Westen</i>, the Germania Ottomans<a href=\"http://www.derwesten.de/politik/polizei-geht-gegen-neuen-rockerclub-osmanen-germania-vor-id11506758.html\" target=\"_blank\">originated from the Nomads Turkey</a>. But members strongly deny that claim. \"It's just speculation,\" says Tiger. Stephan Strehlow adds: \"We don't have any indication that the founding was directed from the outside.\"</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012162-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"152634\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012162.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>But from its Facebook page and other pictures one can find online, the Germania Ottomans seem to at least have a very friendly relationship with Aygün M. and the Hells Angels in Giessen. \"The Germania Ottomans are very clear about sympathizing with the Hells Angels,\" clarifies Stephan Strehlow. \"The group in Berlin has declared its support for Hells Angels MC Giessen.\"</p><p>But Tiger denies this claim: \"We were privately involved with some of them—so we've had dinner together this one time. But other than that, we're not involved with anybody.\" The only photographs from that dinner show both bosses <a href=\"http://images.google.de/imgres?imgurl=https://2010sdafrika.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hamc-osmanen-3.jpg&imgrefurl=https://2010sdafrika.wordpress.com/tag/insider/&h=720&w=960&tbnid=OEU6VKO-J_SHWM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=120&docid=50svbpvVkJnCaM&usg=__H6DqYKTN83GgdFk42qHMdpSDTJ0=&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC7LPO8PnKAhUFCCwKHadtD_4Q9QEIITAA\" target=\"_blank\">proudly standing side by side</a>. </p><p>One of the founders of the Germania Ottomans is a former member of the Hells Angels, and the group has adopted the same ranks and a lot of the same imagery from the biker scene. Tiger has \"13\" tattooed on his hand, which is Hells Angels code for the letter \"M\" (for marijuana). Tiger claims that for the Germania Ottomans, 13 stands for its 13 secret laws—apparently, \"all good ones—like loyalty.\"</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012188-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"152635\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012188.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>He would rather talk about the group's successes with youth outreach work, which to the Germania Ottomans is a central element of its operation. \"A lot of us used to be street kids, and some of us have been to jail. We want to give young people opportunities, so that doesn't happen to them.\" That's why the members came together to convert an old factory building into a training gym. The Germania Ottomans are also strictly against alcohol and drugs: \"People selling drugs or poisoning others with drugs get kicked out.\" The same goes for members who are involved in prostitution rings.</p><p>But if a member would struggle with a drug problem, they can count on support from the group: \"We're a socially-minded club,\" claims Tiger. That's supported by the fact that the club volunteered to handle the security at the funeral of Mohamed, <a href=\"http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/getoeteter-fluechtlingsjunge-berlin-nimmt-abschied-von-mohamed/12545578.html\" target=\"_blank\">the refugee boy who was kidnapped and murdered in Berlin-Moabit last year</a>. \"And we have regular barbecue evenings for our members with families, where only people with girlfriends, fiancés, or wives are invited.\" </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012210-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-model-id=\"152637\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012210.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p>However, the police in Berlin and in North Rhine-Westphalia aren't convinced that the Germania Ottomans are purely part of a social club. \"These are people known to the police,\" says Klaus Zimmermann about the Germania Ottomans in North Rhine-Westphalia. \"We know they are active in violent crime, and some have a record of offenses involving narcotics or weapons.\" But is it impossible that these people just came together and started a boxing club? \"That's what they say,\" says Stephan Strehlow. \"We can't confirm that.\"</p><p>The German authorities don't seem to know what exactly to make of the the Germania Ottomans—they don't even know how many of them are in Germany at the moment. Tiger and his followers claim they have over 2,500 members in Germany, and more across Europe. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the police only know of about a hundred members; in Berlin \"30 to a maximum of 50 people\"—which Tiger claims is 70. </p><p>While we're getting ready to go, Tiger emphasizes again that \"everything I've said is the truth. We make an honest living here, our conscience is clear.\" Later, he sends me a message on WhatsApp, in which he insists I add this to the end of my article: \"If something happens, we'll stand and fight to the last drop of blood.\" </p><p><em>Scroll down for portraits of all the guys we met that day:</em> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012236.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152638\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012236.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012251.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152639\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012251.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012260.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152640\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012260.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012269.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"799\" data-model-id=\"152641\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012269.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012290.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152643\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012290.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012299.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"801\" data-model-id=\"152644\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012299.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012316.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152645\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012316.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/03/03/meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012325.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=\" data-original-width=\"800\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-model-id=\"152647\" data-path=\"images/content-images/2016/03/03/\" data-crop-path=\"images/content-images-crops/2016/03/03/\" data-image-filename=\"meeting-germanys-newest-gang-the-osmanen-germania-876-body-image-1457012325.jpg\" class=\"vmp-image\"> </p>",
