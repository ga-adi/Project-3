Cardviews in the app displays pertinent information that caters to the user's preference.

The application includes support for access to social media information from Facebook, Reddit, Meetup and Foursquare.  A user account would be needed in order for the feed to be active for network tasks or syncs in the background.

In addition to the customized user experience, the application also has built-in support for weather and the status of wi-fi on the device wrapped into a minimalist theme without sacrificing functionality.  Late.ly aims to be the hub of the phone device!
